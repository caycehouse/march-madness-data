The '''1996 [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]]''' involved 64 schools playing in [[Single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] play to determine the national champion of men's  [[NCAA Division I]] [[college basketball]]. It began on March 14, 1996, and ended with the championship game on April 1 at [[Continental Airlines Arena]] (now known as Izod Center) in the [[Meadowlands Sports Complex]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]. A total of 63 games were played.

The Final Four venue was notable for several reasons:
*This marked the first time that the NCAA finals had been held in [[New York metropolitan area|Greater New York]] since [[1950 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1950]].
*This was also the last (men's) Final Four to be held in a basketball/hockey-specific facility. Every Final Four since has been held in a domed stadium (usually built for football) because of NCAA venue capacity requirements. Therefore, this was also the ''last'' time the NCAA finals have been held in the Greater New York area and the [[Northeastern United States]] (for the time being).
The Final Four consisted of [[1995–96 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]], making their first appearance in the Final Four since 1993 and eleventh overall, [[1995–96 UMass Minutemen basketball team|Massachusetts]], making their first ever appearance in the Final Four, [[1995–96 Syracuse Orangemen basketball team|Syracuse]], making their third appearance in the Final Four and first since 1987, and [[Mississippi State Bulldogs men's basketball|Mississippi State]], also making their first appearance.

Kentucky won their sixth national championship by defeating Syracuse in the final game 76–67.

[[Tony Delk]] of Kentucky was named the tournament's [[NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]]. Kentucky's run to the championship was one of the most dominant in NCAA tournament history, as the Wildcats won each of their first four games by at least 20 points and won every game by at least 7 points.

The committee that put together the bracket in 1996 was criticized for placing what seemed to be the best two teams in college basketball – [[1995–96 UMass Minutemen basketball team|Massachusetts]] and Kentucky – on the same side of the bracket so that they faced each other in the national semifinal – not the final game itself.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  Note that there are guidelines that the selection committee follows. In 2004 the procedure would be changed so that the regional sites would first be assigned their #1 seeds, then would be placed in the bracket so that the #1 overall seed would face the fourth #1 seed while the second #1 seed would face the third #1 seed, barring any upsets.  However, it must also be noted that although Kentucky was the tourney favorite, Connecticut was the presumed #1 overall seed that season, after compiling a 30–2 record during the season in a strong Big East Conference, including a conference tournament victory.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}  Meanwhile, Kentucky was apparently dropped to #3 overall seed following their defeat to Mississippi State in the SEC conference tournament final.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Kentucky also could not be placed in the Southeast region since the Sweet 16 and Elite 8 games were being played in Kentucky's home arena, Rupp Arena.

Massachusetts, coached by [[John Calipari]], was later stripped of their wins, including the UMass Minutemen's Final Four appearance, by the NCAA because  UMass star [[Marcus Camby]] had accepted illegal gifts from agents. Connecticut, coached by [[Jim Calhoun]], was additionally punished monetarily due to players accepting illegal gifts from agents.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/09/sports/umass-and-uconn-lose-96-honors.html</ref>

East Rutherford became the 25th different host city, and the Continental Airlines Arena the 30th host venue, to host the final four. While the New York metropolitan area is the largest metropolitan area to host the Final Four, and had previously at the old [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]], the town of East Rutherford itself is the smallest town to host a Final Four. Once more, all four regional sites were former and future Final Four sites. The only new venue of the tournament was the Georgia Dome, which would host five regional rounds and three Final Fours before closing in 2017.
