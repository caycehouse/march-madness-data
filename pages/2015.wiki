For the second time, Lucas Oil Stadium hosted the Final Four, marking the seventh time the NCAA's home city has hosted the tournament; it is scheduled to do so again in 2021. The 2015 tournament marked the first time since 2005 that no new venues were used, only the third time since 1950 that this has happened. As of 2018, this is the most recent tournament for Cleveland, Columbus, Jacksonville, Portland, Seattle or Syracuse; of these six cities, only Syracuse has not had its next tournament games scheduled.

==Notables==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}
[[2014–15 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]] entered the tournament unbeaten. After 22 years without an unbeaten team in the tournament, following [[1990–91 UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball team|UNLV in 1991]], this is the second consecutive tournament with an unbeaten team (after [[2013–14 Wichita State Shockers men's basketball team|Wichita State in the previous]]). The Wildcats, by beating [[2014–15 Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball team|Cincinnati]] in the third round, set an NCAA men's record with 36 straight wins to start a season. They would win two more before [[2014–15 Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball team|Wisconsin]] upset them in the Final Four.

Defending national champion [[2014–15 Connecticut Huskies men's basketball team|Connecticut]] did not qualify.

[[2014–15 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]] extended its streak of consecutive tournament appearances to 26 in a row.  They have made each NCAA Tournament dating back to 1990.  Kansas would qualify again the next two seasons to set the record for consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances formerly held by North Carolina (1975–2001).

[[Atlantic Sun Conference]] champion [[2014–15 North Florida Ospreys men's basketball team|North Florida]], [[Big West Conference]] champion [[2014–15 UC Irvine Anteaters men's basketball team|UC Irvine]], and [[Mid-American Conference]] champion [[2014–15 Buffalo Bulls men's basketball team|Buffalo]] made their first respective appearances in the Division I tournament.

With both Buffalo and [[2014–15 Albany Great Danes men's basketball team|Albany]] winning their respective conferences and reaching the tournament, this is the first time two schools in the [[State University of New York]] system have reached the Division I tournament in the same year.<ref>[http://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/blog/morning_roundup/2015/03/buffalo-ualbany-give-suny-two-reps-in-ncaa-men-s.html Buffalo, UAlbany give SUNY two reps in NCAA men's hoops]. ''Business First''. Retrieved March 16, 2015.</ref>

Two teams broke appearance droughts of over 20 years with their bids: [[Colonial Athletic Association]] champion [[2014–15 Northeastern Huskies men's basketball team|Northeastern]] made its first NCAA appearance since [[1991 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1991]], and [[American Athletic Conference|American]] champion [[2014–15 SMU Mustangs men's basketball team|Southern Methodist]] made its first NCAA appearance since [[1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1993]].

Harvard and Yale played a one-game playoff at the Palestra. Harvard won in dramatic fashion.<ref name=ivyleagueplayoff>{{cite press release|url=http://www.ivyleaguesports.com/sports/mbkb/2014-15/releases/2015_Mens_Basketball_Playoff_Details_Announced |title=2015  Men's Basketball Playoff Details Announced |publisher=Ivy League |date=March 9, 2015 |accessdate=March 15, 2015}}</ref>

[[2014–15 Dayton Flyers men's basketball team|Dayton]] played a First Four game at their home arena, which is usually not allowed during the men's tournament. The NCAA selection committee indicated that putting Dayton in its home arena "falls within the context" of the committee's procedures.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/flyers-staying-home-for-start-of-ncaa-tourney/nkXQD/ |title=Flyers staying home for start of NCAA tourney |newspaper=Dayton Daily News |date=March 15, 2015 |first=Brian |last=Kollars}}</ref>

For the first time since [[1995 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1995]], two 14 seeds recorded wins in the Second Round. On March 19, [[2014–15 Georgia State Panthers men's basketball team|Georgia State]] defeated [[2014–15 Baylor Bears basketball team|Baylor]] and [[2014–15 UAB Blazers men's basketball team|UAB]] defeated [[2014–15 Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball team|Iowa State]].

Of the sixteen games played on March 19, five were decided by one point, a single-day record.

For the first time since [[2007 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2007]] and the fourth time since the field expanded to 64 teams in [[1985 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1985]], all four 5 seeds won their Second Round games. This was also the first time since 2007 that there were four 4 vs. 5 matchups in the Third Round.

On March 20, all but one "chalk" team won their game (there was only one upset), compared to the four upsets the previous day.

Michigan State reached its seventh Final Four in the last 18 seasons—the best mark in the nation during that time span.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Legend Of Tom Izzo Grows|date=March 30, 2015|first=Neil|last=Paine|work=FiveThirtyEight|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/tom-izzo-michigan-state-coaching-final-four/}}</ref>

For the first time since [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2009]], multiple 1 seeds reached the Final Four.

For the first time since [[2008 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2008]], two 1 seeds reached the Championship, between Kansas and Memphis (later vacated by Memphis).

Wisconsin was in its first final since [[1941 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1941]], and lost; and Duke in its first final since [[2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2010]], and won.

The Wisconsin loss extended the [[Big Ten Conference]]'s losing streak in National Championship games to six. As of 2015, [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]] is the last Big Ten team to win a National Championship, having done so in [[2000 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2000]].

{{details|NCAA basketball tournament selection process}}

Out of 333 eligible Division I teams, 68 participate in the tournament. Eighteen Division I teams were ineligible due to failing to meet APR requirements, self-imposed postseason bans, or reclassification from a lower division.{{refn|The 18 teams that are ineligible, and the reasons for ineligibility, are:
* APR: Alabama State, Appalachian State, Central Arkansas, Florida A&M, Houston Baptist, Lamar, Milwaukee, San Jose State, Southern
* Other NCAA infractions: Arkansas-Pine Bluff<ref>https://www.ncaa.org/sites/default/files/Arkansas%20Pine%20Bluff%20Infractions%20Decision%20PUBLIC.PDF</ref>
* Self-imposed bans: Southern Miss, Syracuse
* Reclassification: Abilene Christian, Grand Canyon, Incarnate Word, Northern Kentucky, Omaha, UMass Lowell<ref>{{cite web|title=2015 Conference Tournament Central |url=http://www.bloggingthebracket.com/2015/3/1/8127147/2015-conference-tournaments-brackets-schedule-tv-scores-college-basketball |first=Chris |last=Dobbertean |website=SB Nation|accessdate=March 16, 2015|date=March 17, 2015}}</ref>}}

Of the 32 automatic bids, 31 were given to programs that won their [[List of NCAA conferences|conference]] tournaments. The [[Ivy League]] does not hold a tournament, and awards its bid to the team with the best regular-season record. However, whenever two or more teams are tied for the conference title, league rules call for a [[one-game playoff]] between the top two teams (or a series of such playoffs if more than two teams are tied), which occurred in this year.<ref name=ivyleagueplayoff/> The remaining 36 bids were granted on an "at-large" basis, which were extended by the NCAA Selection Committee to the teams it deemed to be the best 36 teams that did not receive automatic bids.

Eight teams—the four lowest-seeded automatic qualifiers and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams—will play in the First Four (the successor to what had been popularly known as "[[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Opening Round game|play-in games]]" through the 2010 tournament). The winners of these games advance to the round of 64.

The [[NCAA basketball tournament selection process|Selection Committee]] will also seed the entire field from 1 to 68.

==Media coverage==
===Story headlines===
The round of 64 started off with multiple upsets with majority of the upsets coming out of the [[Big 12]] conference. The television coverages of [[CBS]] and Turner had one of the best overall ratings on March 20, 2015. According to Nielsen estimates, exclusive coverage of the opening full round of the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship across TBS, CBS, TNT and truTV averaged a 6.6 overnight household rating/14 share — up 10% from last year and the highest since the tournament expanded to four telecast windows for the entire day.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kissell|first1=Rick|title=March Madness Breaks Ratings Record on Opening Day|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/march-madness-ratings-hit-all-time-thursday-high-for-cbs-turner-sports-1201456888/|website=variety.com|accessdate=March 20, 2015}}</ref>

One of the upsets that happened was UAB upsetting No. 3 seed Iowa State 60-59. The 19-15 UAB Blazers qualified for the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2011 by winning three-straight to earn the Conference USA tournament title and an automatic bid.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Greenberg|first1=Neil|title=UAB Blazers are tournament's first bracket buster|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fancy-stats/wp/2015/03/19/no-14-uab-blazers-could-be-the-tournaments-first-bracket-buster/|website=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=March 20, 2015}}</ref>

Baylor, a No. 3 seed, took on No. 14 seed [[Georgia State Panthers men's basketball|Georgia State]] and with less than three minutes to go, Georgia State staged a 13-0 run to beat Baylor. "The comeback was punctuated with a three by [[R. J. Hunter]], son of stool-bound coach [[Ron Hunter]], that has already produced a moment sure to go down in history – the elder Hunter, who already tore his Achilles celebrating the team's Sun Belt conference tourney victory, fell off that stool in ecstasy after his son's three dropped to give the Panthers the 57-56 lead that would be the final margin,"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hutchins|first1=Andy|title=2015 March Madness bracket: Georgia State stages dramatic upset of Baylor, Arizona rolls|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2015/3/19/8259901/march-madness-2015-bracket-ncaa-tournament-georgia-state-upset|website=sbnation.com|accessdate=March 20, 2015}}</ref> according to Andy Hutchins.

However, the most talked about headline was UCLA not only making the tournament despite a poor performance in the [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-12]], but also with a call with 13 seconds left when UCLA took on SMU and coach [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]]. A late second [[goaltending]] that cost SMU the game sparked a lot of attention in sports media and social media. The Bruins moved on to play UAB in the Round of 32. Both teams played each other earlier in the season, when UCLA beat the Blazers 88-76 in the Bahamas back in November. Sam Vecenie a CBS writer, was quoted saying, "Funny part of that story? It was the last-place game of the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament. Cool to see how these two teams have turned around their season."<ref>{{cite web |last=Vecenie |first=Sam |title=Goaltend call lifts UCLA past SMU; should goaltending be reviewable?|url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/eye-on-college-basketball/25114503/goaltending-with-013-left-leads-ucla-to-upset-over-smu |publisher=CBS Sports |accessdate=March 20, 2015}}</ref>
