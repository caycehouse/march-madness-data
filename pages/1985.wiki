The '''1985 [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]]''' involved 64 schools playing in [[Single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] play to determine the national champion of men's  [[NCAA Division I]] [[college basketball]]. This was the first year the field was expanded to 64 teams, from 53 in the previous year's tournament. It began on March 14, 1985, and ended with the [[1985 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] on April 1 in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. A total of 63 games were played.

Eighth-seed [[1984–85 Villanova Wildcats men's basketball team|Villanova]], coached by [[Rollie Massimino]], won their first national title with a 66&ndash;64 victory in the [[1985 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game|final game]] over [[1984–85 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team|Georgetown]], coached by [[John Thompson (basketball)|John Thompson]]. [[Ed Pinckney]] of Villanova was named the tournament's [[NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]]. The game, often cited as "The Perfect Game", is widely considered among the greatest upsets in college basketball history, and is the second biggest point-spread upset in Championship Game history.<ref>[https://www.si.com/longform/2015/1985/villanova/ Sports Illustrated]</ref><ref>[http://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/04/31-years-later-villanova-wildcats-played-another-perfect-game-at-the-final-four-oklahoma-buddy-hield USA Today]</ref> This Villanova team remains the lowest-seeded team to win the tournament. The Wildcats are also notable as the last Division I men's national champion to date to represent a school that did not sponsor varsity [[College football|football]] at the time of its title (Villanova had dropped [[Villanova Wildcats football|football]] after the 1980 season and did not reinstate the sport until the 1985 season, the first after the championship game). The game is also notable as the last played without a [[shot clock]].

This year's Final Four saw an unprecedented and unmatched three teams from the same conference, with [[Big East Conference|Big East]] members Villanova and Georgetown joined by [[1984–85 St. John's Redmen basketball team|St. John's]]. The only "interloper" in the Big East party was [[Memphis Tigers men's basketball|Memphis State]], then of the [[Metro Conference]]. (Memphis State's 1985 Final Four appearance was vacated due to using ineligible players, as were all of its tournament appearances from 1982–1986.)

This was also the first year that one of the regionals was named "Southeast", replacing "Mideast." This name was used until [[1998 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1998]], when the regional was renamed "South." This was also the last tournament until 2010 to feature two private schools in the title game. This tournament was also the last until 2012 to feature no teams in the sweet 16 from the Mountain or Pacific Time Zones.

This tournament's East Region is the only one in NCAA Tournament history in which the higher-seeded team won every game.

Lexington became the 21st host city, and Rupp Arena the 23rd host venue, for the Final Four. Lexington is the smallest metropolitan area to host a Final Four, and due to the use of domed football stadiums, it is unlikely to host a Final Four again despite the size of Rupp Arena.  The 1985 tournament was the last time an off-campus arena (or, for that matter, any arena) whose primary tenant was a college team was used for a tournament. (The [[Meadowlands Arena|Continental Airlines Arena]] (in 1996) was the main arena for [[Seton Hall Pirates]], but they were not the primary tenants.) This tournament also marks the last time a domed stadium was not used for any tournament games; before 1985, the four previous tournaments and the 1971 tournament were the only tournaments to include them. The other implication of this is that it was the only tournament between 1984 and 1993 to not feature an NFL stadium. Denver was the only new city or venue host games in 1985. At the time, the city did not host a NCAA Division I institution, making it just one of a handful of host cities all-time to do so. 1985 would be the last time the Providence Civic Center would host the regional rounds; all subsequent tournaments would be early rounds. The tournament would also mark the last time the University of Tulsa's Mabee Center would host games; the tournament would not return to the city until 2011, when the [[BOK Center]] hosted.
