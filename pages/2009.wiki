The '''2009 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament''' was a tournament involving 65 schools playing in a [[single-elimination tournament]] to determine the national champion of men's NCAA Division I [[college basketball]] as a culmination of the [[2008–09 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2008–09 basketball season]]. It began on March 17, 2009, and concluded with the [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] on April 6 at [[Ford Field]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], where the University of North Carolina defeated [[2008–09 Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team|Michigan State]] to become the champion. The 2009 tournament marked the first time not only for a Final Four having a minimum seating capacity of 70,000 but also by having most of the tournament in the February Sweeps of the Nielsen Ratings due to the [[digital television transition in the United States]] on June 12, 2009, which also made this the last NCAA Basketball Tournament, in all three divisions, to air in analog television. The [[University of Detroit Mercy]] hosted the Final Four, which was the 71st edition.

Prior to the start of the tournament, the top ranked team was [[2008–09 Louisville Cardinals men's basketball team|Louisville]] in both the [[AP Top 25]] and the [[Coaches' Poll|ESPN/USA Today Coaches']] Polls, followed by [[2008-09 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|North Carolina]], [[Memphis Tigers men's basketball|Memphis]], and [[2008–09 Pittsburgh Panthers men's basketball team|Pittsburgh]].<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/rankings?seasonYear=2009 2009 NCAA Men's Basketball Rankings (Mar. 16) on ESPN.com]</ref> Only the Tar Heels of North Carolina were the regional winners and played in the Final Four. The Tar Heels completed one of the most dominant runs in the tournament's history by winning each of their games by at least twelve points.

For the first time since seeding began, all #1-#3 seeds made it into the Sweet 16, and for the third consecutive time, all #1 seeds made the Elite Eight.

Four schools made their NCAA tournament debut, all respective conference champions: Binghamton (America East), Morgan State (MEAC), Stephen F. Austin (Southland), and North Dakota State (Summit), a school in its first season of Division I eligibility.

Sixty-five teams were selected for the tournament. Thirty of the teams earned automatic bids by winning their [[List of NCAA conferences|conference]] tournaments. The automatic bid of the [[Ivy League]], which does not conduct a postseason tournament, went to {{cbb link|2008|sex=men|team=Cornell Big Red|school=Cornell University|title=Cornell}}, its regular season champion. The remaining 34 teams were granted "at-large" bids by the NCAA Selection Committee.

Two teams play an opening-round game, popularly called the "[[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Opening Round Game|play-in game]]". The winner of that game advances to the main draw of the tournament as a 16 seed and plays a top seed in one of the regionals. The 2009 game was played on Tuesday, March 17, at the [[University of Dayton Arena]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]], as it has since its inception in [[2001 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2001]].

All 64 teams were seeded 1 to 16 within their regions; the winner of the play-in game automatically received a 16 seed. The [[NCAA basketball tournament selection process|Selection Committee]] seeded the entire field from 1 to 65. SEC commissioner [[Michael Slive]] served his last year as chairman of the committee.


The first and second round games were played at the following sites:<ref>{{cite web|title=NCAA Championships |url=http://www.ncaa.com/champ/m-baskbl-d1-champ.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5iiVE6mFu?url=http://www.ncaa.com/champ/m-baskbl-d1-champ.html |archivedate=2009-08-02 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2009-05-31 |df= }}</ref>

:[[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]], [[Minneapolis|Minneapolis, Minnesota]] (host: [[University of Minnesota]])

The four regionals are officially named after their areas, a practice which resumed in 2007. Between 2004 and 2006, the regionals were named for their host cities. The following were the sites for the 2009 regionals:
;Regionals: Thursday and Saturday, March 26 and 28, 2009
:'''East''', [[TD Garden|TD Banknorth Garden]], [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]] (host: [[Boston College]])
:'''West''', [[University of Phoenix Stadium]], [[Glendale, Arizona]], Arizona (host: [[Arizona State University]])<!--Originally referred to by the old name "Cardinal Stadium" in official NCAA materials and on NCAA.com, apparently because the naming rights sponsor is a for-profit university with no athletic programs. However, this has been changed in the version of the site retrieved on February 7, 2009.-->
;Regionals: Friday and Sunday, March 27 and 29, 2009
:'''South''', [[FedExForum]], [[Memphis, Tennessee]] (host: [[University of Memphis]])
:'''Midwest''', [[Lucas Oil Stadium]], [[Indianapolis|Indianapolis, Indiana]] (hosts: [[Horizon League]] & [[Butler University]])

Regional winners advanced to the Final Four, hosted at [[Ford Field]] in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] by the [[University of Detroit Mercy]] on April 4 (semifinals) and April 6 (National Championship). 

Detroit was the 28th new host city, and Ford Field the 35th new venue, to host the Final Four. The tournament featured six new stadiums, including two domed stadiums. The Phoenix suburb of Glendale was host for the first time, with games being held at the University of Phoenix Stadium, home to football's [[Arizona Cardinals]]. Indianapolis also hosted at a new domed stadium, Lucas Oil Stadium, the replacement for the [[RCA Dome]]. After an eight year hiatus, the tournament returned to Memphis at the FedExForum, the third venue in the city to host the tournament. Kansas City also introduced a new arena, the Sprint Center, after the previous eight appearances at [[Kemper Arena]]. For only the second time, the city of Miami hosted games, this time at the American Airlines Arena, home to the NBA's [[Miami Heat]]. And for the first time since 1975, the tournament returned to Portland, at the new Rose Garden arena. As of 2018, this is the last tournament to feature Ford Field, the Metrodome and American Airlines Arena; Taco Bell Arena, which has not hosted since, will host in 2018. The Metrodome would close in early 2014, to be replaced with [[U.S. Bank Stadium]], which will host the 2019 Final Four.

===Midwest Region===
[[Goran Suton]] of Michigan State was the Midwest regional most outstanding player.  He was joined by Spartan teammates [[Kalin Lucas]] and [[Travis Walton (basketball)|Travis Walton]], Louisville's [[Earl Clark]] and Kansas's [[Cole Aldrich]] on the NCAA Tournament All-Midwest Regional team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wibw.com/sports/headlines/42097582.html|title=Kansas Center Cole Aldrich Named to NCAA Tournament All-Midwest Regional Team|accessdate=2009-03-31|date=2009-03-29|publisher=[[WIBW-TV|WIBW]]}}</ref>

====First round====
To play the top-seeded Louisville Cardinals in the first round, Morehead State defeated Alabama State 58–43, with the Eagles keeping the Hornets without a lead the entire game. This marked the first time either team had played in the tournament in five years; the Eagles had not played since 1984.<ref>{{cite web |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Morehead St. earns matchup with Louisville in tourney|agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN]]|year=2009 |accessdate=2009-03-31 |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=290762011 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090323175709/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=290762011| archivedate= 23 March 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Morehead State fell to Louisville 74–54, the 100th time a 1 seed beat a 16 seed in the tournament since seeding began. However, the Eagles managed to keep the game close until halftime, when Louisville led by only 2 points. In the second half, the Cardinals began to apply their signature fullcourt pressure, forcing turnovers and outscoring Morehead State 22–6 at the beginning of the half. Leon Buchanan's 17 points for the Eagles were not enough to upset Louisville, whose top scorers, [[Samardo Samuels]] and [[Terrence Williams]], scored a combined 28 points. Morehead State has not beaten Louisville in 52 years until [[2011 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2011]].<ref>{{cite web |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Louisville applies pressure in second half to cruise past Morehead State|agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN]]|year=2009 |accessdate=2009-03-31 |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000047 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090325005535/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000047| archivedate= 25 March 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In two overtimes, the Siena Saints beat the Ohio State Buckeyes 74–72. Ohio State had the advantage of playing an hour from their campus, and received 25 points, nine rebounds, and eight assists from [[Evan Turner]]. The Saints made 6 out of 23 3-pointers and had 22 turnovers. Accordingly, Siena trailed for most of the game, but scored the last four points in regulation to force overtime. At the end of the first overtime, Siena's Ronald Moore drained his first 3-pointer to force a second overtime. With 3.9 seconds left in that overtime, he hit a second three from the same location to give the Saints a late 2-point lead. In an attempt to send the game into a third overtime, Turner shot a 15-footer immediately afterwards, but he missed it. This was Siena's fifth appearance in the tournament, after beating [[Vanderbilt University]] in 2008 as a 13 seed.<ref>{{cite web |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Moore's clutch shots spur Siena by Ohio St. in 2OT|agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN]]|year=2009 |accessdate=2009-03-31 |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000048 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090325005540/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000048| archivedate= 25 March 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

The Arizona-Utah matchup was not as close. The Fifth-seeded Utah Utes were upset by twelfth-seeded Arizona Wildcats, one of the last teams to make it in the tournament and a questionable entry,<ref>{{cite web|title=Scouting Friday's Sweet 16 games – cleveland.com |url=http://www.cleveland.com/marchmadness/index.ssf/2009/03/scouting_fridays_sweet_16_game.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5iiVG9san?url=http://www.cleveland.com/marchmadness/index.ssf/2009/03/scouting_fridays_sweet_16_game.html |archivedate=2009-08-02 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2009-05-31 |df= }}</ref> by a score of 84–71. The Utes closed the lead to two with roughly five minutes left in the game, but the Wildcats' answer was a 10–1 run. Utah's [[Luke Nevill]] committed two fouls less than four minutes into the game and scored only 12 points. [[Nic Wise]] of Arizona, meanwhile, led the team with 29 points, with 21 in the second half. Tyler Kepkay led the Utes with a team 19 points in his embarking performance.  <ref>{{cite web |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Wise's 21 after half propel Arizona past fifth-seeded Utah|agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN]]|year=2009 |accessdate=2009-03-31 |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000050| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090325005545/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000050| archivedate= 25 March 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

The Cleveland State-Wake Forest game was an even larger upset. In their second bid in the tournament, the Cleveland State Vikings shocked the Wake Forest Demon Deacons 84–69. This 15-point win ties for third-greatest victory margin for a 13 seed over a 4 seed. Wake Forest, once ranked first in the country, had 16 turnovers in the matchup, compared to six for the Vikings. [[James Johnson (basketball player)|James Johnson]] of the Demon Deacons scored 22 points, although this could not compensate for a substandard offense. Their scoring leader, [[Jeff Teague (basketball)|Jeff Teague]], finished with 10 points, half his average. For these reasons, Wake Forest never obtained a lead, while Cleveland State sank three consecutive 3-pointers in the early minutes of the game.<ref>{{cite web |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Cleveland State races to early lead to knock out Wake Forest|agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN]]|year=2009 |accessdate=2009-03-31 |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000051| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090325085623/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000051| archivedate= 25 March 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

For the first time in 19 years, Dayton advanced to the second round of the tournament with a win over West Virginia 68–60. This also ended West Virginia's first-round winning streak, which had lasted since 1992. [[Chris Wright (basketball, born 1988)|Chris Wright]] led the Dayton Flyers with 27 points, a career high, while also chalking up 10 rebounds. [[Charles Little (basketball player)|Charles Little]] also aided the Flyers with 18 points. [[Darryl Bryant]], who led West Virginia with 21 points, shot two consecutive three-pointers to bring Dayton's lead to 48–47 with 11:02 minutes left in the game. However, that was the closest the Mountaineers had to a lead outside the beginning of the game.<ref>{{cite web |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Flyers shake Huggins hex, take down sixth-seeded West Virginia|agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN]]|year=2009 |accessdate=2009-03-31 |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000054| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090323143647/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000054| archivedate= 23 March 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In their first eligible year, North Dakota State appeared in the tournament, facing defending champion Kansas. The three-seeded Kansas Jayhawks staved off the fourteenth-seeded Bison's upset bid with an 84–74 victory. [[Ben Woodside]] shined with 37 points for the Bison, his sixth game of the season with at least 30 points. However, [[Sherron Collins]] and [[Cole Aldrich]] proved too much for North Dakota State, accounting for 65 percent of the Jayhawks' points with 32 and 23 respectively.<ref>{{cite web |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Kansas holds off North Dakota State as Collins pours in 32|agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN]]|year=2009 |accessdate=2009-03-31 |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000055| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090323233521/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000055| archivedate= 23 March 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

The tenth-seeded USC Trojans demolished the seventh-seeded Boston College Eagles by a score of 72–55, helped by [[Taj Gibson]]'s 10-for-10 shooting from the field, tied for the second-best NCAA tournament field-goal shooting performance in history. He led the team with 24 points and recorded six rebounds, five assists, and three blocks. [[Dwight Lewis]] also added 20 points for the Trojans. After leading 34–30 at halfime, the Eagles scored just a single field goal during one 13-minute stretch, as part of a 23.1 shooting percentage in the second half.<ref>{{cite web |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=USC rolls as Gibson's 10-for-10 shooting leads to upset of Boston College|agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN]]|year=2009 |accessdate=2009-03-31|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000057| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090325005552/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000057| archivedate= 25 March 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
 
Robert Morris, the region's 15 seed, was blown away by second-seeded Michigan State 77–62. The game was tied with 4:44 left in the first half, but then the Colonials went almost 20 minutes without scoring a single point. The Spartans took advantage of this for a 21–0 run that sealed the game in their favor. The Colonials' Jeremy Chappell was the only team member to score double-digit points with 11, and he also led the team with six rebounds, two steals, and three blocks.

====Second round====
Ninth-seeded Siena faced top seed Louisville, with the Cardinals emerging victorious 79–72. Taking advantage of Louisville's 19 turnovers, the Saints came back from a 12-point deficit with 17:21 left in the game to snatch the lead around the 9-minute mark. [[Edwin Ubiles]] broke through Louisville's full-court pressure and added 24 points for Siena. [[Terrence Williams]], known as one of the most relaxed players on the Cardinals roster, saved his team by grabbing rebounds and making 3s. He led the team with 24 points, 15 rebounds, two steals, and four assists. [[Earl Clark]] also helped the Cardinals' cause with 12 points and 12 rebounds.<ref>{{cite web |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Louisville reaches 2nd straight Sweet 16 behind Williams' double-double|agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN]]|year=2009 |accessdate=2009-04-02 |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000049| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090326083855/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000049| archivedate= 26 March 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In a 12 vs. 13 seed Cinderella matchup, Arizona handily defeated Cleveland State. The Wildcats' zone defense puzzled Cleveland State, and their fast breaks sealed the game. The smallest deficit the Vikings faced was 48–44 about midway through the second half, though the Wilcats then went on a 13–2 run led by [[Nic Wise]]'s five consecutive points. His 21 points led the team's four double-digit scorers. Arizona was excellent behind the free-throw line, finishing 24 for 28.<ref>{{cite web |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Wildcats reach final 16 for 12th time since '88|agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN]]|year=2009 |accessdate=2009-04-03 |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000052| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090325174609/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000052| archivedate= 25 March 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

[[Cole Aldrich]]'s [[triple-double]] with 13 points, 20 rebounds, and 10 blocked shots paved the way for a third-seeded Kansas win over 11 seed Dayton. This was only the sixth triple-double in NCAA tournament history. With 43 points, Dayton scored the fewest points they had all season, compared to Kansas's 60. Despite their small point total, the Flyers shot 72 times, its most all season, amounting to a 22.2 shooting percentage. The Jayhawks were also not having one of their better offensive games, with [[Sherron Collins]] being an exception; he made 25 points. This marked the third straight Sweet Sixteen appearance for Kansas.<ref>{{cite web |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Aldrich's 13 points, 20 boards, 10 blocked shots lead KU to Sweet 16 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN]]|year=2009 |accessdate=2009-04-03 |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000056| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090325110638/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000056| archivedate= 25 March 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Playing the tenth-seeded [[USC Trojans]], second-seeded Michigan State utilized [[Travis Walton (basketball)|Travis Walton]]'s career-high 18 points for a 74–69 win. Normally known as a defensive player and averaging 4.9 points per game, Walton shot 8 for 13 from the field. His team out-rebounded USC 33 to 23, and USC made only one three-point play. Star Trojan [[Taj Gibson]] was in foul trouble throughout much of the game, and yet his teammates rallied for 14 lead changes and 16 ties. [[Dwight Lewis]], who gave a 19-point performance overall, scored six consecutive points for USC for a late tie. The Spartans only earned a victory after the Trojans missed their last nine shots. With the win, Michigan State has made it to the Sweet 16 eight times of the last 12 years, more than any other team except Duke.<ref>{{cite web |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Walton's career-high 18 lift Spartans over USC, into Sweet 16|agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN]]|year=2009 |accessdate=2009-04-04 |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000059| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090326085834/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000059| archivedate= 26 March 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

====Regional semifinals (Sweet Sixteen)====
Louisville, the region's top seed, routed twelfth-seeded Arizona 103–64. In NCAA tournament history, this was Louisville's largest win and Arizona's largest loss. It was no surprise, given the Cardinals' 57.6 field goal percentage and their 48% shooting behind the arc. Their fullcourt pressure forced 15 turnovers on the Wildcats the entire game, including nine in the first half. [[Earl Clark]] led the Cardinals with 19 points, whose ballhandling garnered 29 assists. This was the most lopsided Sweet 16 victory since 1972.<ref>{{cite web |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Cardinals fly into Elite 8 with one-sided victory over Wildcats|agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN]]|year=2009 |accessdate=2009-04-04 |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000053| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090331100301/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000053| archivedate= 31 March 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

The Michigan State-Kansas matchup was much more intense. After overcoming a 13-point first half deficit, the Spartans won 67–62. They shot 16 of 17 from the foul line, and on their only miss they rebounded the ball and gave Raymar Morgan the only points of the night on a dunk. Such rallies in the second half narrowed the deficit and occasionally took the lead, although the Jayhawks responded and were up by 2 with 2 minutes left in the game. They were helped by [[Sherron Collins]] and [[Cole Aldrich]]'s combined 37 points. However, [[Kalin Lucas]] of the Spartans, who had scored 11 points in the first 39 minutes of the game, made seven straight points with 48 seconds left. [[Goran Suton]] also added nine rebounds, five steals, and a season-high 20 points for Michigan State.<ref>{{cite web |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Lucas, Spartans eliminate Jayhawks with late free throws |agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN]]|year=2009 |accessdate=2009-04-04 |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000060| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090331101224/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000060| archivedate= 31 March 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

====Regional final (Elite Eight)====
Michigan State defeated overall number one seed Louisville, 64–52, to advance to their fifth Final Four since 1999. Michigan State held Louisville to their second lowest point total of the season with their man-to-man defense keeping them out of sync all game. Center Goran Suton had 19 points and Durrel Summers had 12 in the rout. Earl Clark had 19 for Louisville.

====Regional semifinals (Sweet Sixteen)====
Connecticut faced Purdue at University of Phoenix Stadium in a West Regional semifinal.

In the nightcap of the sweet sixteen matchups, two sets of Tigers met, pitting Missouri against Memphis in a matchup that saw teams with similar fast-paced styles meet. Missouri was able to pull away with a 27–7 run that gave them a 64–40 lead.

Top scorers in the game were [[Eric Maynor]] (21) for VCU and [[Josh Shipp (basketball)|Josh Shipp]] (16) for UCLA.

===Final Four===
All final four teams in the tournament had won at least one national championship. Entering the tournament, North Carolina had the most, with four ([[1957 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1957]], [[1982 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1982]], [[1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1993]], [[2005 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2005]]); Connecticut had two; ([[1999 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1999]], [[2004 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2004]]); Michigan State also had two; ([[1979 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1979]], [[2000 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2000]]), and Villanova won one; ([[1985 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1985]]).

The Spartans had home court advantage by playing in their home state. Six teams have played the Final Four in their home states, but only four of them won. UCLA ([[1968 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1968]], [[1972 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1972]], [[1975 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1975]]) and North Carolina State ([[1974 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1974]]) won the national title, but Duke ([[1994 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1994]]) and Purdue ([[1980 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1980]]) lost in the Final Four. The biggest advantage came in 1968 and 1972 when UCLA played the championship game at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]], which is a short distance from [[Pauley Pavilion]], their home court since 1965.

==Media==

===Television===
Once again, except for the play-in game, which was telecast on [[ESPN]], [[CBS Sports|CBS]] and [[CBS College Sports Network]] served as broadcasters on television for the tournament. The only change from past years at the Final Four was that [[Jim Nantz]] worked with [[Clark Kellogg]] in the [[color commentary]] position instead of [[Billy Packer]], who left CBS in July 2008. 

*Studio: [[Greg Gumbel]], [[Greg Anthony]] and [[Seth Davis]]   
*[[Jim Nantz]] and [[Clark Kellogg]] and [[Tracy Wolfson]] (she was only used as sideline reporter for the Final Four and NCAA Championship game) – First & Second Round at Greensboro, North Carolina; South Regional at Memphis, Tennessee; Final Four at Detroit, Michigan
*[[Dick Enberg]] or [[Carter Blackburn]] and [[Jay Bilas]] – Blackburn Thursday afternoon; Enberg Thursday night, First & Second round at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; West Regional at Glendale, Arizona   
*[[Verne Lundquist]] and [[Bill Raftery]] – First & Second Round at Dayton, Ohio; East Regional at Boston, Massachusetts
*[[Gus Johnson (sportscaster)|Gus Johnson]] and [[Len Elmore]] – First & Second Round at Minneapolis, Minnesota; Midwest Regional at Indianapolis, Indiana   
*[[Kevin Harlan]] and [[Dan Bonner]] – First & Second Round at Portland, Oregon   
*[[Ian Eagle]] and [[Jim Spanarkel]] – First & Second Round at Miami, Florida
*[[Craig Bolerjack]] and [[Bob Wenzel]] – First & Second Round at Boise, Idaho   
*[[Tim Brando]] and [[Mike Gminski]] – First & Second Round at Kansas City, Missouri   
   
For the play-in game in Dayton, ESPN had [[Brent Musburger]], [[Steve Lavin]] and [[Erin Andrews]] working as the announcers. 

Some CBS affiliates put additional game broadcasts on digital subchannels, or, as in the following two instances, on other stations:
*[[WOIO]] and [[WUAB-TV|WUAB]] ([[Raycom Media]] [[duopoly]]): On March 20, WOIO aired Ohio State vs. Siena, while Cleveland State vs. Wake Forest was on WUAB at the same time.  The [[Cleveland]] area has a substantial number of OSU alumni, and [[Mansfield, Ohio|Mansfield]], although part of the Cleveland market, is equidistant to both [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] and Cleveland.
*[[KOTV-DT|KOTV]] and [[KQCW]] (Griffin Media duopoly): Also on March 20, KOTV aired Oklahoma State vs. Tennessee; at the same time, Kansas vs. North Dakota State was on KQCW.  The reason for this simulcast is that part of the Tulsa market includes [[Coffeyville, Kansas|Coffeyville]] and other communities at the southern end of Kansas.

===Radio===
[[Westwood One (1976–2011)|Westwood One]] was once again the radio home for the tournament.
