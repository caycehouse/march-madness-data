The '''1987 [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]]''' involved 64 schools playing in [[Single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] play to determine the national champion of men's  [[NCAA Division I]] [[college basketball]]. It began on March 12, 1987, and ended with the [[1987 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] on March 30 in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. A total of 63 games were played.

[[1986–87 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|Indiana]], coached by [[Bob Knight]], won the national title with a 74–73 victory in the final game over [[1986–87 Syracuse Orangemen basketball team|Syracuse]], coached by [[Jim Boeheim]]. [[Keith Smart]] of Indiana, who hit the game-winner in the final seconds, was named the tournament's [[NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]]. The tournament also featured a "Cinderella team" in the Final Four, as [[Providence College]], led by a then-unknown [[Rick Pitino]], made their first Final Four appearance since 1973.  This was also the last tournament in which teams were allowed to have home court advantage: Syracuse (2E), DePaul (3MW), Arizona (10W) and UAB (11SE) all opened the tournament playing on their home courts.  The 1987 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament was also the first tournament to use the [[Three-point field goal|three-point shot]].

There were two new venues, the Hoosier Dome in Indianapolis and the Rosemont Horizon, located in suburban Chicago. This marked the first time the Tournament returned to the Chicago area in twenty years. This also marked the last appearance of the original Charlotte Coliseum, moving to the [[Charlotte Coliseum|new Coliseum]] in 1991.

==Trivia==
* The [[59th Academy Awards]] show was broadcast on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC network]] at the same time as [[College Basketball on CBS|CBS network]] broadcast of the championship game between Indiana and Syracuse. Oscars show host [[Chevy Chase]] quipped later in the evening, "Is the game over yet?" The Oscars show would subsequently be scheduled around the tournament broadcast by moving it later in April for two years.
* [[Angelo Pizzo]] and [[David Anspaugh]], nominated for Oscars for the movie ''[[Hoosiers]]'' and Indiana University grads, skipped the Oscars to watch IU win the championship game against Syracuse.
* Tenth seeded LSU reached the Elite Eight for the second straight year without being favored to win a game. They had previously reached the Final Four as an 11-seed in 1986, losing to eventual national champion Louisville Cardinals. The Tigers missed a shot at the buzzer and fell short of another trip to the Final Four, losing 77-76 to eventual national champion Indiana.
* This marked the first time that [[CBS Sports]] used "[[One Shining Moment]]" during their tournament epilogue.
* The three losing coaches in the Final Four all eventually won national titles. Jerry Tarkanian was the first to do so, winning in [[1990 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1990]] with [[1989–90 UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball team|UNLV]] defeating the [[Duke University]] [[Duke Blue Devils|Blue Devils]] 103–73.  The following year 1991, Duke defeated UNLV in the National Semi-final game to end UNLV's chance to finish undefeated.  Rick Pitino followed in [[1996 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1996]] with [[1995–96 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]], defeating Jim Boeheim's [[1995–96 Syracuse Orangemen basketball team|Syracuse]] team in the final. Boeheim would finally break through in [[2003 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2003]] with [[2002–03 Syracuse Orangemen basketball team|Syracuse]] by defeating the Roy Williams coached University of Kansas Jayhawks.  Williams left Kansas to coach the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for the 2003–2004 season.  Coach Williams would win the first of three national championships in 2005 as the head coach of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
* There were no teams from the [[Metro Conference]], [[Big South Conference]] or [[Gulf Star Conference]] in the tournament.  The Metro Conference allowed [[Memphis Tigers men's basketball|Memphis State]], which was serving an NCAA tournament ban that year, to compete in its conference tournament, which it won by defeating the defending 1986 National Champion [[Louisville Cardinals]] by the lopsided score 75 to 52 on the Cardinals' home court, Freedom Hall in Louisville, Kentucky.  The NCAA basketball tournament committee said as the conference had committed its automatic berth would go to its conference tournament winner, the conference lost its automatic berth that year, and no other schools received an at-large entry.  Most conferences now prohibit teams on postseason bans from participating in conference tournaments as a result, or have provisional automatic bids awarded to the eligible team that advanced the most.
