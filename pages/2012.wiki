The '''2012 [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]]''' was a [[single-elimination tournament]] involving 68 schools playing to determine the national champion of men's NCAA Division I [[college basketball]]. It began on March 13, 2012, and concluded with the [[2012 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] on April 2 at the [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome]] in [[New Orleans]].

The Final Four consisted of [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]], making their second appearance in the Final Four under [[John Calipari]], [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]], making their second appearance under [[Rick Pitino]] and first since 2005, [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]], making their first appearance since winning the 2008 national championship under head coach [[Bill Self]] by defeating Calipari's [[Memphis Tigers men's basketball|Memphis]] team, and [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball|Ohio State]], making their first appearance since their runner-up finish in 2007 and second under coach [[Thad Matta]].

Kentucky defeated Kansas 67-59 to win their first national championship since [[Tubby Smith]] led the team there in 1998. This was Calipari's first national championship in four trips to the Final Four, having previously gone there with Kentucky in 2011, Memphis in 2008 and [[UMass Minutemen men's basketball|Massachusetts]] in 1996.

Upsets were once again the story of the tournament in 2012, and for the first time ever two #15 seeds won in the same tournament. In the South Region, #15 [[Lehigh Mountain Hawks men's basketball|Lehigh]] of the [[Patriot League]] defeated #2 [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]]. In the West Region, #15 [[Norfolk State Spartans men's basketball|Norfolk State]] of the [[Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference|MEAC]], making their first ever NCAA tournament appearance, defeated #2 [[Missouri Tigers men's basketball|Missouri]]. In addition to this, [[Ohio Bobcats men's basketball|Ohio]] won a game as a double digit seed for the second time in four tournaments as the #13 seed Bobcats defeated #4 seed [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|Michigan]] to advance to the third round of the Midwest Region. A team from the First Four games also won in the Round of 64 for the second consecutive year as [[South Florida Bulls men's basketball|South Florida]] defeated Midwest #5 seed [[Temple Owls men's basketball|Temple]], setting up a #12 vs. #13 matchup that Ohio won.

[[VCU Rams men's basketball|Virginia Commonwealth]], a Final Four team from 2011 as an #11 seed, made the 2012 tournament as a #12 seed and once again made the round of 32 by defeating South #5 seed [[Wichita State Shockers men's basketball|Wichita State]]. The South Region saw four double digit seeds win in their opening games, as [[Colorado Buffaloes men's basketball|Colorado]] and [[Xavier Musketeers men's basketball|Xavier]] joined VCU and Lehigh as victors. Xavier advanced to the Sweet Sixteen, where they were defeated by [[Baylor Bears men's basketball|Baylor]].

Despite the upsets, all four top seeds advanced to the Sweet Sixteen for the first time since 2009. Three made it to the Elite Eight, as only [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]] of the West Region lost. Kentucky was the only one to advance to the Final Four as [[Syracuse Orange men's basketball|Syracuse]] and [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]] lost in their regional finals.

Two teams made their first NCAA tournament appearances in school history: [[Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference|MEAC]] champion [[2011-12 Norfolk State Spartans men's basketball team|Norfolk State]] and [[Summit League]] champion [[2011–12 South Dakota State Jackrabbits men's basketball team|South Dakota State]]. [[Ivy League]] champion [[2011-12 Harvard Crimson men's basketball team|Harvard]] made its first appearance since 1946.

All four teams from the state of [[Ohio]] (Cincinnati, Ohio, Ohio State, and Xavier) made it to the Sweet 16, marking the first time in tournament history any state has been represented by four teams in the round of 16.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/tournament/2012/story/_/id/7719220/ncaa-tournament-2012-pride-ohio-four-teams-state-reach-sweet-16 Ohio is more than just Buckeye State] ESPN.com, March 21, 2012</ref> This tournament was also the first tournament since 1985 to feature no teams in the Sweet 16 from the Mountain or Pacific Time Zones.

==Tournament procedure==
{{details|NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship#Current tournament format}}

A total of 68 teams entered the tournament. Thirty out of 31 automatic bids were given to the teams that won their [[List of NCAA conferences|conference]] tournament. The remaining automatic bid was awarded to the [[Ivy League]] regular season champion since they do not hold a conference tournament. The remaining 37 teams were granted "at-large" bids, which were extended by the NCAA Selection Committee on March 11.

Eight teams—the four lowest-seeded automatic qualifiers and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams—will play in the First Four (the successor to what had been popularly known as "[[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Opening Round game|play-in games]]" through the 2010 tournament). The winners of these games will advance to the main draw of the tournament.

For the first time ever, the [[NCAA basketball tournament selection process|Selection Committee]] publicly disclosed the overall rankings for each team, which are listed below.<ref>[http://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2012-03-11/hardcore-breakdown-bracket 'Hardcore' breakdown of bracket] NCAA, March 11, 2012</ref>

The Final Four returned to the Superdome for the fifth time overall and first time since before [[Hurricane Katrina]]; it is scheduled to host again in 2022.  The tournament saw two new arenas in previous host cities. For the first time since 1991, the tournament returned to the city of Louisville at its new KFC Yum! Center, the downtown home of the [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville Cardinals]] and successor venue to [[Freedom Hall]]. And for the first time in ten years, the city of Pittsburgh hosted the tournament, this time at Consol Energy Center, which replaced the [[Civic Arena (Pittsburgh)|Civic Arena]] as Pittsburgh's main arena. As of 2018, this is the most recent year hosting for the Dome at America's Center, the Greensboro Coliseum, The Pit and Talking Stick Resort Arena; of these, only the Greensboro Coliseum has been selected thus far for a future site, in 2020.
