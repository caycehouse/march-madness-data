The '''2006 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament''' involved 65 teams playing in a [[single-elimination tournament]] to determine the national champion of men's NCAA Division I [[college basketball]] as a culmination of the [[2005–06 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2005–06 basketball season]]. It began on March 14, 2006, and concluded on April 3 at the [[RCA Dome]] in [[Indianapolis|Indianapolis, Indiana]].

None of the Tournament's top seeds advanced to the Final Four, the first time since [[1980 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1980]] that this occurred. For the second time in history, a team seeded 11th advanced to the Final Four as [[2005–06 George Mason Patriots men's basketball team|George Mason]] of the [[Colonial Athletic Association]] won the Washington, D.C. region. They were joined by Atlanta region winner [[2005–06 LSU Tigers basketball team|LSU]] (who was the first team to advance to the Final Four as an 11-seed in [[1986 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1986]]), Oakland region winner [[2005–06 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|UCLA]], who had not made the Final Four since they won the National Championship in [[1995 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1995]], and Minneapolis region winner [[2005–06 Florida Gators men's basketball team|Florida]], who had not made the Final Four since their [[1999–2000 Florida Gators men's basketball team|runner-up finish]] in [[2000 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2000]] also in Indianapolis.

Florida won their first ever national basketball championship by defeating UCLA 73–57 in the final game. Florida's [[Joakim Noah]] was named the [[NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]] of the NCAA Tournament.

George Mason's run was one of several upsets by lower-seeded teams in the tournament. For the second consecutive year, a No. 14 seed beat a No. 3 seed as [[Northwestern State Demons basketball|Northwestern State]] defeated [[2005–06 Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball team|Iowa]]. No. 13 seed [[2005–06 Bradley Braves men's basketball team|Bradley]] also defeated No. 4 seed [[2005–06 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]] and advanced to the Sweet Sixteen by defeating No. 5-seeded [[Pittsburgh Panthers men's basketball|Pittsburgh]] in the Second Round. Two No. 12 seeds won as well, as [[Montana Grizzlies basketball|Montana]] and [[2005–06 Texas A&M Aggies men's basketball team|Texas A&M]] both won their respective First Round matchups. For the second straight year, [[Milwaukee Panthers men's basketball|Milwaukee]] won as a double-digit seed, this time as the No. 11-seeded Panthers defeated [[Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball|Oklahoma]] in the First Round.

A total of 65 teams were selected to participate in the tournament. Of that total, 31 of the teams earned automatic bids by winning their [[List of NCAA conferences|conference]] tournaments. [[Penn Quakers men's basketball|Penn]] earned an automatic bid by winning the regular-season title of the [[Ivy League]], which did not conduct a conference tournament. The remaining 34 teams were granted "at-large" bids, which are extended by the NCAA Selection Committee.

The initial game on March 14 officially named the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Opening Round|Opening Round game]], but popularly called the "play-in game", had [[Monmouth Hawks men's basketball|Monmouth]], winner of the [[2006 Northeast Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|Northeast Conference Tournament]], facing [[Hampton Pirates men's basketball|Hampton]], who won the [[MEAC Men's Basketball Tournament|Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference Tournament]], for a chance to play top seed [[2005–06 Villanova Wildcats men's basketball team|Villanova]] in the First Round of the Tournament. Monmouth defeated Hampton, 71–49, to advance to play Villanova.

All teams were seeded from 1 to 16 within their regions. The [[NCAA basketball tournament selection process|Selection Committee]] seeded the entire field from 1 to 65. In a practice used since [[2004 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2004]], the ranking of the four top seeds against each other would determine the pairings in the Final Four. The top overall seed would be seeded to play the fourth overall seed in the national semifinals, should both teams advance that far. In 2006, these rankings were as follows: No. 1 [[Duke University|Duke]], No. 2 [[University of Connecticut|Connecticut]], No. 3 [[Villanova University|Villanova]], and No. 4 [[University of Memphis|Memphis]].<ref>[http://www.newsday.com/sports/uconn-nova-no-1-seeds-1.649881 UConn, 'Nova No. 1 seeds]</ref>

The first and second-round games were played at the following sites:
*March 16/18:
:[[Viejas Arena|Cox Arena]], [[San Diego|San Diego, California]] (Host: [[San Diego State University]])
:[[Greensboro Coliseum Complex|Greensboro Coliseum]], [[Greensboro, North Carolina]] (Host: [[Atlantic Coast Conference]])
:[[Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena]], [[Jacksonville, Florida]] (Host: [[Jacksonville University]])
:[[Jon M. Huntsman Center]], [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City, Utah]] (Host: [[University of Utah]])
*March 17/19:
:[[American Airlines Center]], [[Dallas|Dallas, Texas]] (Host: [[Big 12 Conference]])
:[[The Palace of Auburn Hills]], [[Auburn Hills, Michigan]] (Host: [[Oakland University]])
:[[UD Arena|University of Dayton Arena]], [[Dayton, Ohio]] (Host: [[University of Dayton]])
:[[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)|Wachovia Center]], [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] (Host: [[Atlantic 10 Conference]])

The four regionals were officially named after the four host cities, a practice which also began in 2004. However, in [[2007 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2007]], the NCAA returned to naming regionals by their geographic location. The 2006 regionals were: 
*March 23/25:
:'''Atlanta Regional''', [[Georgia Dome]], [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]] (Host: [[Georgia Institute of Technology]])
:'''Oakland Regional''', [[Oracle Arena|Oakland Arena]], [[Oakland, California]] (Host: [[University of San Francisco]])
*March 24/26:
:'''Minneapolis Regional''', [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]], [[Minneapolis|Minneapolis, Minnesota]] (Host: [[University of Minnesota Twin Cities|University of Minnesota]])
:'''Washington, D.C. Regional''', [[Capital One Arena|Verizon Center]], [[Washington, D.C.]] (Host: [[Georgetown University]])

Each regional winner advanced to the Final Four, held on April 1 and 3 at the [[RCA Dome]] in [[Indianapolis|Indianapolis, Indiana]], hosted by [[Butler University]] and the [[Horizon League]]. This was the fourth and final time the RCA Dome would host the Final Four before moving to [[Lucas Oil Stadium]]. For the first time, the tournament came to Jacksonville, Florida, playing games at the Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena. This marked the sixth city and fifth metropolitan area in the state of Florida to host games. The 2006 tournament also marked the final tournament games held at the Huntsman Center and Oakland (now Oracle) Arena. Tournament games have moved to downtown Salt Lake City and the [[Vivint Smart Home Arena]] since, to take advantage of more amenities there as opposed to the campus of the [[University of Utah]]. As for Oakland, there are currently no games scheduled in the near future, with 2022 scheduled to host games at the new [[Chase Center (arena)|Chase Center]] in downtown [[San Francisco]]. As the [[Golden State Warriors]] will also be moving to the Chase Center once it opens, it is unclear what will happen to the Oracle Arena once their primary tenant moves out.

==Notes==
*The futures of two of this year's Final Four teams would be polar opposites of the other two in 2007. Both [[2006–07 George Mason Patriots men's basketball team|George Mason]] and LSU would fail to receive a bid to either the [[2007 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] or the [[2007 National Invitation Tournament|NIT]], while both [[2006–07 Florida Gators men's basketball team|Florida]] and [[2006–07 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|UCLA]] would return to the Final Four (the two teams would have a rematch, this time in the semifinals, with the same result, a Florida victory).
* George Mason became the first team from a "mid-major" conference to reach the Final Four since [[1990–91 UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball team|UNLV]]'s loss to [[1990–91 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team|Duke]] in [[1991 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1991]].
* This was the second of three Final Fours to feature no No. 1 seeds ([[1980 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1980]] and [[2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2011]] being the others).
* Duke was the last team before Florida to win back-to-back titles, and like Florida, they won their first of the two in Indianapolis at the RCA Dome.
