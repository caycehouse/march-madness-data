For the second time, Indianapolis was the host of the Final Four, this time at the Hoosier Dome, which would host the Final Four three more times. The tournament also returned to Charlotte in 1991, this time to the new Charlotte Coliseum, then the off-campus home of the [[Charlotte 49ers men's basketball]] team. This year also saw the final appearance of the Pontiac Silverdome and two former Final Four venues, in Cole Field House and Freedom Hall. Games played in Detroit since have either been at [[The Palace of Auburn Hills]], [[Ford Field]] or, starting in 2018, [[Little Caesars Arena]]. While both Cole Field House and Freedom Hall have both been replaced, only Freedom Hall's replacement, the [[KFC Yum! Center]], has hosted games since. Games in the Washington area have since been played at either Baltimore, Landover or in Washington itself at [[Capital One Arena]].

==Broadcast information==
For the first time, [[CBS Sports]] showed all 63 tournament games.  In the first three rounds, games were shown on a regional basis, except for one game each on Saturday and Sunday in the second round.  Usual start times were noon and 7:30 or 8 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|Eastern time]] on each of the Thursdays and Fridays.  During the weekend of the second round, the national telecast began at noon, with the regional windows (three on Saturday, two on Sunday) following.  Although the times would be adjusted, the same basic format was in place until [[2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2010]].  As of [[2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2011]], the regional broadcasts have been replaced by simulcast feeds on non-broadcast networks owned by [[Turner Sports]].

==Miscellaneous==
*Duke's 79-77 win over UNLV in the Final Four became one of the biggest upsets in tournament history. Duke was an 8-point underdog in the game.  UNLV's juggernaut 1990–91 squad ranked #2 on [[ESPN Classic]]'s ''Who's #1?'' for Best Teams Not To Win a Title.  UNLV was undefeated entering the 1991 tournament, which was unmatched until Wichita State in 2014 and [[2014-15 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]] in 2015. (Saint Joseph's went unbeaten in the 2004 regular season, finishing 27-0, but lost in their conference tournament before the NCAAs. [[Alcorn State Braves men's basketball|Alcorn State]] went unbeaten in the 1979 regular season, but got invited to the [[1979 National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] and lost to eventual winner [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana]] in the 2nd round. Indiana is the last team to win the championship undefeated in 1976).
*This was Duke's fourth consecutive Final Four trip, the first team to achieve such a feat since UCLA.  Since freshmen were not eligible at the time of UCLA's run, Duke's [[Greg Koubek]] became the first player to play in four Final Fours, a record matched by Duke teammates [[Christian Laettner]] and Brian Davis the next year when the team repeated as national champions.
*For the first time in tournament history a 15-seed defeated a 2-seed. Richmond defeated Syracuse 73-69. Since then this has happened seven additional times: in 1993, Santa Clara defeated Arizona 64-61; in 1997, Coppin State defeated South Carolina 78-65; in 2001, [[Hampton University|Hampton]] defeated Iowa State 58-57, on the same day in 2012 Norfolk State defeated Missouri 86-84 and Lehigh defeated Duke 75-70, in 2013 Florida Gulf Coast defeated Georgetown 78-68,<ref>http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=330810046</ref> and in 2016, Middle Tennessee defeated Michigan State 90-81.
*In the Final Four against [[1990–91 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]], legendary [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]] coach [[Dean Smith]] was ejected from the game for leaving the coach's box.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/31/sports/college-basketball-smith-ejected-on-2-technicals.html?pagewanted=all</ref>
*For [[bracketology|bracketologists]], this tournament is notable for several reasons.  The first is the upset-heavy opening round, which led to every seed number except 16 being represented by at least one team in the second round.  The East region, in particular, featured first round victories by seeds 9, 10, 12, 13, and 15.  Two 11's and a 14-seed advanced in the other regions.  The second round is equally remarkable because there were ''no upsets''  in this round whatsoever.  The combination of these two anomalies led to an unprecedented occurrence in which a 10 ([[Temple University|Temple]]), an 11 ([[University of Connecticut|Connecticut]]), and a 12-seed ([[Eastern Michigan University|Eastern Michigan]]) advanced to the Sweet Sixteen without any of the teams pulling off consecutive upsets.  The reason for this was that the first round successes of 15-seed [[University of Richmond|Richmond]], 14-seed [[Xavier University (Cincinnati)|Xavier]], and 13-seed [[Penn State]] led to Temple, Connecticut, and Eastern Michigan (respectively) being considered ''favorites'' for their second round matchups.
*This was the first NCAA Tournament to feature all four [[North Carolina]]-based [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] teams: [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]], [[NC State Wolfpack basketball|North Carolina State]], [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]], and [[Wake Forest University|Wake Forest]].
*The Final Four was the first to include both halves of the [[Carolina-Duke rivalry|North Carolina-Duke rivalry]]. Had both teams won, they would have faced each other for the national championship, but to this day, the teams have only faced each other once in the NCAA Tournament or NIT – the [[1971 National Invitation Tournament|1971 NIT]] semifinals at Madison Square Garden, which North Carolina won 73-67.
*This tournament featured three play-in games before the tournament field was announced, featuring the champions of the six conferences with the lowest computer ratings the previous season.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/06/sports/basketball-fordham-takes-aim-at-an-ncaa-berth.html |title=Fordham takes aim at an NCAA berth |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |first=Malcolm |last=Moran |date=March 6, 1991 |accessdate=March 4, 2016}}</ref> The results were: [[Saint Francis Red Flash men's basketball|Saint Francis, Pennsylvania]] ([[Northeast Conference|NEC]]) defeated [[Fordham Rams men's basketball|Fordham]] ([[Patriot League|Patriot]]) 70-64,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/07/sports/basketball-fordham-s-road-to-ncaa-blocked-by-st-francis-70-64.html |title=Fordham's road to NCAA blocked by St. Francis, 70-64 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |first=Malcolm |last=Moran |date=March 7, 1991 |accessdate=March 4, 2016}}</ref> [[Coastal Carolina Chanticleers men's basketball|Coastal Carolina]] ([[Big South Conference|Big South]]) over [[Jackson State Tigers basketball|Jackson State]] ([[Southwestern Athletic Conference|SWAC]]) 78-59,<ref name=NELA>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/07/sports/basketball-northeast-louisiana-wins-ncaa-bid.html |title=Northeast Louisiana wins NCAA bid |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 7, 1991 |accessdate=March 4, 2016}}</ref> and [[Louisiana–Monroe Warhawks men's basketball|NE Louisiana]] ([[Southland Conference|Southland]]) over [[Florida A&M Rattlers basketball|Florida A&M]] ([[Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference|MEAC]]) 87-63.<ref name=NELA/> These are not opening round games and the losers are not credited with a NCAA tournament appearance.
