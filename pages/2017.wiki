The '''2017 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament''' involved 68 teams playing in a [[single-elimination tournament]] to determine the men's [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] [[college basketball]] national champion for the [[2016–17 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2016–17 season]]. The 79th edition of the tournament began on March 14, 2017, and concluded with the [[2017 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] on April 3 at [[University of Phoenix Stadium]] in [[Glendale, Arizona]]. The championship game was the first to be contested in a Western state since [[1995 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1995]] when [[Seattle]] was the host of the Final Four for that year.

In the Final Four, [[2016–17 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|North Carolina]] beat [[2016–17 Oregon Ducks men's basketball team|Oregon]] (making their first Final Four appearance since [[1939 NCAA Basketball Tournament|1939]])<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.si.com/college-basketball/2017/04/01/north-carolina-oregon-final-four-results-recap|title=UNC holds off Oregon, to face Gonzaga in final|last=Woo|first=Jeremy|work=SI.com|access-date=2017-05-05}}</ref> while [[2016–17 Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball team|Gonzaga]] defeated [[2016–17 South Carolina Gamecocks men's basketball team|South Carolina]] (both making their first ever Final Four appearance).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/final-four-2017-gonzaga-holds-on-to-beat-south-carolina-advances-to-title-game/|title=Final Four 2017: Gonzaga holds on to beat South Carolina, advances to title game|work=CBSSports.com|access-date=2017-05-05|language=en}}</ref> North Carolina then defeated Gonzaga 71–65 to win the national championship.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/sports/ncaabasketball/north-carolina-beats-gonzaga-ncaa-champions.html|title=North Carolina Stops Gonzaga, Turning Heartbreak Into Joy|last=Schonbrun|first=Zach|date=2017-04-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-05|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

==Tournament procedures==
{{details|NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament#Current tournament format}}

A total of 68 teams entered the 2017 tournament, with all 32 [[List of NCAA conferences|conference]] tournament winners receiving an automatic bid. The [[Ivy League]], which previously granted its automatic tournament bid to its regular season champion, hosted a postseason tournament to determine a conference champion for the first time. In previous years, had the Ivy League had two schools tied for first in the standings, a one-game playoff (or series as was the case in the 2002 season) determined the automatic bid. On March 10, 2016, the Ivy League's council of presidents approved a four-team tournament where the top four teams in the regular season would play on March 11 and 12 at Philadelphia's [[Palestra]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=The Ivy League Adds Men's, Women's Basketball Tournaments Beginning in 2017|url=http://ivyleaguesports.com/information/general_releases/2015-16/releases/The_Ivy_League_Adds_Mens-Womens_Basketball_Tournaments_Beginning_in_2017|publisher=[[Ivy League]]|date=March 10, 2016|accessdate=March 3, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311041901/http://ivyleaguesports.com/information/general_releases/2015-16/releases/The_Ivy_League_Adds_Mens-Womens_Basketball_Tournaments_Beginning_in_2017|archivedate=March 11, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The remaining 36 teams received "at-large" bids which are extended by the NCAA [[NCAA basketball tournament selection process|Selection Committee]]. On January 24, 2016, the NCAA announced that the Selection Committee would, for the first time, unveil in-season rankings of the top four teams in each division on February 11, 2017.<ref name="usatoday-earlypreview">{{cite news|last=Auerbach|first=Nicole|title=Midseason March Madness sneak preview should bring positive buzz|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/columnist/nicole-auerbach/2017/01/24/ncaa-tournament-sneak-preview-march-madness-top-16-seeds/96992158/|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=January 24, 2017|accessdate=March 3, 2017}}</ref>

Eight teams—the four lowest-seeded automatic qualifiers and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams—played in the First Four (the successor to what had been known as "[[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Opening Round game|play-in games]]" through the 2010 tournament). The winners of these games advanced to the main draw of the tournament.

The [[NCAA basketball tournament selection process|Selection Committee]] also seeded the entire field from 1 to 68.<ref>{{cite news|title=March Madness bracket: How the 68 teams are selected for the Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|url=http://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2016-02-18/march-madness-bracket-how-68-teams-are-selected-division-i|publisher=National Collegiate Athletic Association|date=February 18, 2016|accessdate=March 3, 2017}}</ref>

The committee's selections resulted in two historic milestones. The [[Northwestern Wildcats men's basketball|Northwestern Wildcats]] of the [[Big Ten Conference]] made their first-ever NCAA Tournament in school history, officially becoming the last "power conference" school to make the tournament. (This fact is ironic considering that Northwestern hosted the [[1939 NCAA Basketball Tournament|first-ever NCAA Tournament in 1939]]). The Wildcats' First Round opponent, the [[Vanderbilt Commodores men's basketball|Vanderbilt Commodores]] of the [[Southeastern Conference]], also made history: with a record of 19-15, they set the mark for the most ever losses for an at-large team in tournament history.

Four conference champions also made their first NCAA appearances: [[2016–17 North Dakota Fighting Hawks men's basketball team|North Dakota]] ([[Big Sky Conference]]), [[2016–17 UC Davis Aggies men's basketball team|UC Davis]] ([[Big West Conference]]), [[2016–17 Jacksonville State Gamecocks men's basketball team|Jacksonville State]] ([[Ohio Valley Conference]]), and first-year Division I school [[2016–17 Northern Kentucky Norse men's basketball team|Northern Kentucky]] ([[Horizon League]]).

The city of Glendale, a Phoenix suburb, became the 30th host city, and the University of Phoenix Stadium became the 39th host venue, to host a Final Four. For the second straight year, no regional games were held in domed stadiums, a move dictated in 2013 by the NCAA to limit use of the stadiums for the regional rounds.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Katz|first1=Andy|title=3-point shot: UConn gets APR on track|url=http://www.espn.com/blog/collegebasketballnation/post/_/id/85451/3-point-shot-uconn-gets-apr-on-track|website=ESPN.com|accessdate=February 23, 2018}}</ref> The tournament featured two new arenas in previously visited markets. For the first time the tournament was held at the Bankers Life Fieldhouse, the home of the [[Indiana Pacers]]. This marks the first time since 1982 that a venue other than the [[RCA Dome]] or [[Lucas Oil Stadium]] hosted games within the city of Indianapolis. It also became the fifth venue within the city to host games, temporarily tying Indianapolis with Houston for the most different venues used within a city; Houston will add a sixth venue when the [[Toyota Center]] hosts games in the 2020 tournament.  The tournament also returned to Sacramento, moving to the brand new Golden 1 Center, home of the [[Sacramento Kings]], replacing [[Sleep Train Arena]] as the city's primary indoor sports venue.  The 2017 tournament marked the last time that the Bradley Center will be used for tournament games, as it is being replaced by the [[Wisconsin Entertainment and Sports Center]] in late 2018. The WESC is scheduled to host the tournament in 2022.

The tournament also saw a shift in location of first round games from [[Greensboro, North Carolina]] to [[Greenville, South Carolina]]. Greensboro originally was awarded First and Second Round games, but the games were relocated due to NCAA objections over [[North Carolina]]'s passage of [[Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act|HB2]]. This was also the first time a South Carolina venue hosted the tournament in 15 years, after the state removed [[Modern display of the Confederate flag#Removal from South Carolina State Capitol|the Confederate battle flag from the South Carolina State House grounds]] in July 2015 and the NCAA implemented a policy of not hosting championship games in the state in response to the display in 2002.

==Qualification and selection==
