The '''2003 [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]]''' involved 65 schools playing in [[Single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] play to determine the national champion of men's  [[NCAA Division I]] [[college basketball]]. It began on March 18, 2003, and ended with the [[2003 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] on April 7 in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] at the [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome|Superdome]]. A total of 64 games were played.

The Final Four consisted of [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]], making their second straight appearance, [[Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball|Marquette]], making their first appearance since they won the national championship in 1977, [[Syracuse Orange men's basketball|Syracuse]], making their first appearance since 1996, and [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]], making their first appearance since 1947. Texas was the only top seed to advance to the Final Four; the other three (Arizona, Kentucky, and Oklahoma) advanced as far as the Elite Eight but fell.

Syracuse won their first national championship in three tries under [[Jim Boeheim]], defeating Kansas 81–78 in what would be [[Roy Williams (coach)|Roy Williams]]' final game as head coach of the team; he would depart to become the head coach at [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]], a position he still holds as of the 2017–2018 season.

[[Carmelo Anthony]] of Syracuse was named the tournament's [[NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]].

Syracuse beat four Big 12 teams on its way to the title: [[Oklahoma State]], [[University of Oklahoma|Oklahoma]], [[University of Texas|Texas]], and [[University of Kansas|Kansas]]. Those victories helped earn Boeheim the national title that had eluded him in [[1987 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1987]] and [[1996 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1996]].

The 2003 play-in game was played on Tuesday, March 18, at the [[University of Dayton]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]], as it had been since its inception in [[2001 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2001]].

Each regional winner advanced to the [[Final Four]] at the [[Louisiana Superdome]], [[New Orleans]], hosted by the [[Sun Belt Conference]] and the [[University of New Orleans]]. The semi-final games were held on April 5 and the final on April 7, 2003. New Orleans was the host city for the fourth time, and the first time since 1993. There were three new venues, only one of which was in a new host city. For the first time, the tournament came to Spokane, Washington and the Spokane Arena. Previous games in eastern Washington had been played on the campus of Washington State University, who was host of the games despite the arena being the alternate home court for the [[Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball|Gonzaga Bulldogs]]. The tournament returned to Oklahoma City in 2003, to the then-new Ford Center, which replaced the [[Cox Convention Center]] across the street as the city's major arena. And for the first time since 1983, the tournament returned to the city of Tampa at the St. Pete Times Forum, home to the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[Tampa Bay Lightning]]. The tournament had been held across [[Tampa Bay]] at [[Tropicana Field]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]] three times between appearances in Tampa. To date, this is the last tournament to feature what is now known as the Times Union Center in Albany; however, the tournament is scheduled to return to New York's state capital in 2020.

*:Freshman [[Carmelo Anthony]] scored 33 points leading the [[Syracuse University|Syracuse Orangemen]] past the [[University of Texas at Austin|Texas Longhorns]] in the night cap of the National Semifinal doubleheader. Syracuse opened up a comfortable 2nd half lead, but that was trimmed to four with just 1:08 remaining. However, freshman [[Gerry McNamara]] iced the game with clutch foul shooting in the final minutes. The win put Syracuse and coach [[Jim Boeheim]] one win away from their first ever National Championship. Texas was the last number one seed remaining in the tournament.<ref name="CNNSI4.5-1">{{cite web|author=[[CNN Sports Illustrated]]|publisher=CNNSI.com|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/men/recaps/2003/04/05/5151_recap.html|title=2003 NCAA National Semifinals: (E3) Syracuse 95, (S1) Texas 84|accessdate=2008-03-06}}</ref>

*: Leading up to the championship game, much of the conversation revolved around how, no matter the outcome, one of the well-known head coaches would win their first championship.<ref name="Wojciechowski">{{cite web |url =http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/ncaatourney03/columnist?id=1534793&name=wojciechowski_gene |title =Boeheim, Williams say title won't define careers |last =Wojciechowski |first =Gene |date =April 6, 2003 |website =ESPN.com |publisher =ESPN the Magazine |accessdate =November 16, 2013}}</ref> In Jim Boeheim's 27 years as head coach at Syracuse his team had been to two Final Fours, and finished runner-up each time ([[1987 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1987]], [[1996 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1996]]).<ref name="Wojciechowski"/>   Roy Williams, during his fifteen seasons as Kansas head coach, had reached the Final Four four times, and finished runner up once ([[1991 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1991]]).<ref name="Wojciechowski"/>  Syracuse dominated with a hot shooting first half to lead by 11 at the break. Gerry McNamara connected on an impressive six [[three-pointers]] in the half, which were his 18 points for the game. Kansas fought back to within 80–78 in the final minute and had a chance to tie after [[Hakim Warrick]] missed a pair of [[free throws]] in the final moments. Warrick, however, then blocked Michael Lee's three point attempt with 1.5 seconds remaining on the game clock. After Kirk Hinrich's three-pointer at the buzzer went over the net, Syracuse's victory gave them, and Jim Boeheim, their first ever national championship. Carmelo Anthony was named [[NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]] (MOP) with 21 points in the win. Syracuse also avenged a second-round loss to Kansas [[2001 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|two years earlier]].<ref name="CNNSI4.7">{{cite web|author=[[CNN Sports Illustrated]]|publisher=CNNSI.com|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/men/recaps/2003/04/07/5154_recap.html|title=2003 NCAA National Championship: (E3) Syracuse 81, (W2) Kansas 78|accessdate=2008-03-06}}</ref>

==Broadcast information==
Originally, CBS Sports was to have shown all 63 games of the tournament following the opening round, which was on [[ESPN]].  However, because of the start of the [[Iraq war]] the night before, the afternoon games on Thursday and Friday were moved to ESPN while retaining CBS graphics and production. CBS News then joined other broadcast and non-broadcast outlets in showing [[media coverage of the Iraq War|extended news coverage]].

Thursday and Friday night's games were shown on CBS, albeit with frequent [[CBS News|news updates]]. To make up for lost advertising revenue, an additional time slot was opened the following Sunday evening for more CBS telecasts.

2003 also marked the debut of [[Mega March Madness]] as an exclusive package on [[DirecTV]]. This offered additional game broadcasts not available to the viewer's home market during the first three rounds of the tournament. All games from the 4th round (Elite Eight) onward were national telecasts.

[[Westwood One (1976–2011)|Westwood One]] had exclusive national radio coverage.
