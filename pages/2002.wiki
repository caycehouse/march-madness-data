The '''2002 [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]]''' involved 65 schools playing in [[Single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] play to determine the national champion of men's  [[NCAA Division I]] [[college basketball]]. It began on March 12, 2002, and ended with the [[2002 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] on April 1 in [[Atlanta]] at the [[Georgia Dome]]. A total of 64 games were played.

This was the first year that the tournament used the so-called "pod" system, in which the eight first- and second-round sites are distributed around the four regionals. Teams were assigned to first round spots in order to minimize travel for as many teams as possible. The top seeds at each site were:

*[[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]: [[University of Oregon|Oregon]] (M2), [[University of Southern California|USC]] (S4)
*[[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]]: [[University of Arizona|Arizona]] (W3), [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]] (W4)
*[[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]]: [[University of Oklahoma|Oklahoma]] (W2), [[Mississippi State University|Mississippi State]] (M3)
*[[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]: [[University of Kansas|Kansas]] (M1), [[University of Kentucky|Kentucky]] (E4)
*[[Chicago]]: [[University of Georgia|Georgia]] (E3), [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|Illinois]] (M4)
*[[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]: [[University of Cincinnati|Cincinnati]] (W1), [[University of Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh]] (S3)
*Washington, D.C.: [[University of Maryland, College Park|Maryland]] (E1), [[University of Connecticut|Connecticut]] (E2)
*[[Greenville, South Carolina|Greenville]]: [[Duke University|Duke]] (S1), [[University of Alabama|Alabama]] (S2)

The Final Four consisted of [[Maryland Terrapins men's basketball|Maryland]], making their second consecutive appearance, [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]], making their first appearance since 1993, [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana]], making their first appearance since 1992, and [[Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball|Oklahoma]], making their first appearance since their national runner-up finish in 1988.

Maryland defeated Indiana 64-52 in the championship game to win their first ever national championship.

[[Juan Dixon]] of Maryland was named the tournament's [[NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]].

For the second straight tournament, the Elite Eight featured at least one double-digit seed. South Region tenth-seed [[Kent State Golden Flashes men's basketball|Kent State]] and West Region twelfth-seed [[Missouri Tigers men's basketball|Missouri]] played in their respective regional finals, with Kent State losing to Indiana and Missouri losing to Oklahoma.

This also marked the first time since 1987 that no team from the states of North Carolina nor Kentucky reached the Final Four.

===Regionals===
;March 21 and 23:

;March 22 and 24:
:'''East Regional''', [[Carrier Dome]], [[Syracuse, New York]] (Host: [[Syracuse University]])
:'''Midwest Regional''', [[Kohl Center]], [[Madison, Wisconsin]] (Host: [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]])

===Final Four===
;March 30 and April 1:
:[[Georgia Dome]], [[Atlanta]] (Host: [[Georgia Institute of Technology]])

For the second time, Atlanta was the host city of the Final Four, with the Georgia Dome becoming the 33rd host venue. The Georgia Dome also currently holds the distinction of being the most recent Final Four venue to close and be demolished, as it did so in 2017 after the opening of [[Mercedes-Benz Stadium]], which will host the Final Four in 2020. The tournament included three new venues and two new host cities. The American Airlines Center in Dallas, which opened in 2001, replaced [[Reunion Arena]] as the city's primary winter sports venue. The Kohl Center on the campus of the [[University of Wisconsin]] brought the tournament back to Wisconsin's capital city for the first time since 1969, although it has not returned since. And the city of Greenville, South Carolina's Bi-Lo Center hosted for the first time in 2002; however, due to the [[Modern display of the Confederate flag#Display at South Carolina State Capitol|Confederate flag controversy]] at the South Carolina State Capitol, the NCAA chose not to return to the arena until 2017, two years after the flag was removed. The 2002 tournament was the last time that the Pittsburgh Civic Arena (then called Mellon Arena) hosted the tournament; it closed in 2010 and games have since been played at its replacement, [[PPG Paints Arena]].

*:For the second straight year the [[University of Maryland, College Park|Maryland Terrapins]] earned a bid to the Final Four. This time they would take advantage of their trip. After falling behind 13-2 to the [[University of Kansas|Kansas Jayhawks]] to begin the game, Maryland stormed to a 44-37 lead at halftime. They expanded their lead to 20, 83-63, with 6:11 left in the game. [[Roy Williams (coach)|Roy Williams]]' Kansas squad did not quit and closed the gap to 4 with under a minute remaining, but the Terps survived to advance to the championship, 97-88. Maryland senior [[Juan Dixon]] led the contest in scoring with 33.<ref name="CNNSI3.30-1">{{cite web|author=[[CNN Sports Illustrated]]|publisher=CNNSI.com|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/men/recaps/2002/03/30/maj_kaa/|title=2002 NCAA National Semifinals: (E1) Maryland 97, (MW1) Kansas 88|accessdate=2008-03-06}}</ref>

*:[[Mike Davis (basketball coach)|Mike Davis]]'s [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana Hoosiers]] continued their Cinderella ride in the NCAA Tournament by defeating another higher ranked team, the [[University of Oklahoma|Oklahoma Sooners]]. Oklahoma led most of the first half, and took a 34-30 lead into halftime. However, with the score 60-60 late in the 2nd half Indiana broke ahead for good with an easy bucket from [[Jeff Newton]], who led the Hoosiers with 19 points. The Hoosiers outscored the Sooners by 13 in the 2nd half and advanced to the championship game with a 73-64 victory. Oklahoma was coached by [[Kelvin Sampson]], who later in his career would succeed Davis as IU head coach.<ref name="CNNSI3.30-2">{{cite web|author=[[CNN Sports Illustrated]]|publisher=CNNSI.com|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/men/recaps/2002/03/30/oae_iai/|title=2002 NCAA National Semifinals: (S5) Indiana 73, (W2) Oklahoma 64|accessdate=2008-03-06}}</ref>
