It began on March 17, 1994, and ended with the [[1994 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] on April 4 in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], played at [[Charlotte Coliseum]]. A total of 63 games were played.

In 1994 Charlotte became the 24th city, and the Charlotte Coliseum the 29th venue, to host the Final Four. It is the last of four arenas - including [[Market Square Arena]] in 1980, [[Reunion Arena]] in 1986, and [[McNichols Sports Arena]] in 1990 - whose primary tenant was a [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] franchise. (The [[Charlotte 49ers]] had also used the building from its opening to the previous season, but had moved back to reopened [[Bojangles' Coliseum|Independence Arena]], which is seven miles closer to campus than the new Coliseum.) The tournament was the only one between 1985 and 2018 to not include an NFL stadium; the only domed stadium used for the tournament, the Thunderdome, was at the time an NHL arena and is now an MLB stadium. The tournament included five new venues and four new cities, with three of the venues hosting their only tournament games. Two new cities in Florida, Miami and St. Petersburg, were used for the first time. St. Petersburg would go on to host the Final Four in 1999, while this would be the only games held at Miami Arena; subsequent games have been at the new [[American Airlines Arena]]. Landover, an eastern suburb of Washington, D.C., was used for the only time; games in Washington have since been at [[Capital One Arena]], which replaced USAir Arena as home to the city's sports teams. Sacramento became the sixth metropolitan area in California to host games. The Kansas Coliseum was used instead of [[Charles Koch Arena|Levitt Arena]] in Wichita for the only time. This also marked the last tournament for the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena and the Dee Events Center. Games in the Los Angeles area have since been held at the [[Staples Center]] or the [[Honda Center]] in Anaheim. In all, of the thirteen venues used in the 1994 tournament, seven (in Charlotte, Dallas, Landover, Los Angeles, Miami, Sacramento and Wichita) have closed and been replaced, with all but the Kansas Coliseum (which is being converted into an aerospace test facility) and Sacramento's Sleep Train Arena being demolished, its future still not determined since the opening of the [[Golden 1 Center]] downtown. Additionally, the Nassau Coliseum has been renovated into a smaller-capacity building, placing its future use as a tournament site in doubt.
