The '''1990 [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]]''' involved 64 schools playing in [[Single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] play to determine the national champion of [[NCAA Division I]] men's [[college basketball]]. It began on March 15, 1990, and ended with the [[1990 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] on April 2 in [[Denver, Colorado]]. A total of 63 games were played.

[[1989–90 UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball team|UNLV]], coached by [[Jerry Tarkanian]], won the national title with a 103–73 victory in the final game over [[1989–90 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team|Duke]], coached by [[Mike Krzyzewski]]. In doing so, UNLV set the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament record for largest margin of victory in a championship game.  UNLV's win marks the last time a school from a non-[[power conference]] has won the championship game. (The last time a non power conference team won the national championship was in [[1986 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1986]], when Louisville won). [[Anderson Hunt]] of UNLV was named the tournament's [[NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]].

This tournament is also remembered for an emotional run by [[1989–90 Loyola Marymount Lions men's basketball team|Loyola Marymount]] in the West Regional. In the semifinals of the [[West Coast Conference]] tournament, Lions star forward [[Hank Gathers]] collapsed and died due to a heart condition. The WCC tournament was immediately suspended, with the regular-season champion Lions given the conference's automatic bid. The team defeated [[New Mexico State Aggies men's basketball|New Mexico State]], then laid a 34-point thrashing on defending national champion [[1989–90 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team|Michigan]], and defeated [[Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball|Alabama]] in the Sweet Sixteen (the only game in which Loyola Marymount did not score 100 or more points in the tournament) before running into eventual champion UNLV in the regional final. Gathers' childhood friend [[Bo Kimble]], the team's undisputed floor leader in the wake of the tragedy, paid tribute to his friend by attempting his first free throw in each game left-handed despite being right-handed. (Gathers was right-handed, but struggled so much with free throws that he tried shooting them left-handed for a time.) Kimble made all of his left-handed attempts in the tournament.

This tournament marked the first time that the NCAA employed a timekeeping rule that had been conceived by [[FIBA]] and recently the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], in which the final minute of every period counted down in tenths of seconds, unlike whole seconds as in past years.

Denver became the 23rd host city, and McNichols Sports Arena the 26th host venue, for the Final Four, the only time it has hosted. Two new cities, Oakland, California and Richmond, Virginia, became host cities in 1990. Games had not been played in the East Bay region since 1958 when Cal's Men's Gym (now [[Haas Pavilion]]) hosted; the tournament has returned twice since. Richmond became the third city in Virginia, after Blacksburg and Williamsburg, to host tournament games; like the previous cities it has only hosted twice. Additionally, the tournament returned to Knoxville for the first time since 1983, this time at the new Thompson-Boling Arena. This year also marked the second and, to date, last appearance of the Long Beach Arena in the tournament; with newer, larger venues in Los Angeles and Anaheim, it is unlikely to return soon.
