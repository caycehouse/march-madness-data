The '''1986 [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]]''' involved 64 schools playing in [[Single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] play to determine the national champion of men's  [[NCAA Division I]] [[college basketball]]. It began on March 13, 1986, and ended with the [[1986 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] on March 31 in [[Dallas, Texas]]. A total of 63 games were played.

[[1985–86 Louisville Cardinals men's basketball team|Louisville]], coached by [[Denny Crum]], won the national title with a 72–69 victory in the final game over [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]], coached by [[Mike Krzyzewski]]. [[Pervis Ellison]] of [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]] was named the tournament's [[NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]].  Louisville became the first team from outside a power conference to win the championship since the expansion to 64 teams, and remains one of only two teams to do so (the other team was UNLV in 1990).

The 1986 NCAA Men's Basketball Championship Tournament was the first tournament to use a [[shot clock]] limiting the amount of time for any one offensive possession by a team prior to taking a shot at the basket.  Beginning with the 1986 tournament, the [[shot clock]] was set at 45 seconds, which it would remain until being shortened to 35 seconds beginning in the [[1994 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]], and further shortened to 30 seconds (the same as NCAA women's basketball) starting with the [[2016 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]]. The 1986 tournament was also the last to not feature the [[Three-point field goal|three-point shot]].

[[1985–86 LSU Tigers basketball team|LSU]]'s 1985–86 team is tied for the lowest-seeded team (#11) to ever make the [[Final Four]] (with [[George Mason University|George Mason]]'s 2005–2006 team and [[Virginia Commonwealth University|VCU]]'s 2010–2011 team). As of 2016, they are the only team in tournament history to beat the top 3 seeds from their region. LSU began its run to the Final Four by winning two games on [[Pete Maravich Assembly Center|its home court]], leading to a change two years later which prohibited teams from playing NCAA tournament games on a court which they have played four or more games in the regular season. [[Cleveland State University]] became the first #14 seed to reach the Sweet Sixteen, losing to their fellow underdog, Navy, by a single point. This was also the first year in which two #14 seeds reached the second round in the same year, as [[University of Arkansas at Little Rock|Arkansas-Little Rock]] beat #3-seed Notre Dame; however, they lost their second-round game in overtime.  Both feats have only occurred one other time. [[University of Tennessee at Chattanooga|Chattanooga]] reached the Sweet Sixteen as a 14-seed in 1997, and [[Old Dominion University|Old Dominion]] and [[Weber State University|Weber State]] both reached the second round as 14-seeds in 1995.

Every regional final featured a #1 or #2 seed playing a team seeded #6 or lower. The lone #1 seed to not reach the Elite Eight, St. John's (West), was knocked out in the second round by #8 Auburn, which lost to #2 Louisville in the regional final.

It can be argued that these upsets by the 14-seeds launched the NCAA Tournament's reputation for having unknown teams surprise well-known basketball powers, and both happened on the same day. Indiana's stunning loss would be part of the climax in the best-selling book [[A Season On The Brink]].

Another story of the tournament was when [[United States Naval Academy|Navy]] reached the Elite 8 thanks to stunning performances by [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]].
This tournament had no Pac 10,now Pac 12, teams advance beyond the round of 64, this would not occur again until 2018.

Dallas became the 22nd host city, and Reunion Arena the 24th host venue, for the Final Four. While the city itself has not hosted another Final Four, the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex would host again in 2014 at [[AT&T Stadium]]. Three of the four venues used for regional sites, and all four host cities, were Final Four host cities; only The Summit did not host a Final Four (all Final Fours in Houston have been at either the [[Astrodome]] or [[NRG Stadium]]). This also marked the first time that domed stadiums were used in the opening rounds, with Syracuse's Carrier Dome and the Metrodome in Minneapolis hosting games. The Metrodome and the Long Beach Arena were the only new venues this year. While the city of Long Beach itself had not hosted games before, it is part of the Los Angeles metropolitan area which has hosted multiple times. Since 1986, every tournament has included at least one domed stadium, something that had only happened five times beforehand (1971 and 1981-84).
