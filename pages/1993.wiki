The '''1993 [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]]''' involved 64 schools playing in [[Single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] play to determine the national champion of men's  [[NCAA Division I]] [[college basketball]]. It began on March 18, 1993, and ended with the [[1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] on April 5 in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. A total of 63 games were played.

[[1992–93 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|North Carolina]], coached by [[Dean Smith]], won the national title with a 77–71 victory in the final game over [[1992–93 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team|Michigan]], coached by [[Steve Fisher]].<ref>{{YouTube|7HhZBaCAa80|1993 National Championship Game}}</ref> [[Donald Williams (basketball)|Donald Williams]] of North Carolina was named the tournament's [[NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]]. The most memorable play in the championship game came in the last seconds as Michigan's [[Chris Webber]] tried to call a timeout with his team down by 2 points when double-teamed by North Carolina.<ref>{{YouTube|Vn-_URq7K04}}</ref>  Michigan had already used all of its timeouts, so Webber's gaffe resulted in a [[technical foul]]. Michigan subsequently [[University of Michigan basketball scandal|vacated its entire 1992–93 schedule]], including its six NCAA Tournament games, after it emerged that Webber had received under-the-table payments from a booster.

In a game that featured two great individual battles (one between [[Bobby Hurley]] and [[Jason Kidd]], and the other between [[Grant Hill (basketball)|Grant Hill]] and [[Lamond Murray]]), two-time defending champion [[1992–93 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team|Duke]] was upset in the second round by [[California Golden Bears men's basketball|California]].

This year's Final Four was the closest the tournament came to having all four top seeds advance to the semifinals until all four did advance in the [[2008 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2008 tournament]]. [[1992–93 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|Indiana]] was the only top seed not to make it out of its regional; it was defeated by the 2-seed [[1992–93 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]], in the Midwest regional finals. This tournament is also notable for the uneven distribution of first-round upsets.  While there were no upsets in the East, one 'minor' upset in the Midwest (9th seed [[Xavier Musketeers men's basketball|Xavier]] defeated 8th seed [[New Orleans Privateers men's basketball|New Orleans]]; Xavier was the betting favorite at all sports books in [[Las Vegas]]), and one 'medium' upset in the Southeast (11th seed [[Tulane Green Wave men's basketball|Tulane]] beat 6th seed [[Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball|Kansas State]]), the West featured ''three'' remarkable upsets amongst the top 5 seeds, with a 12, a 13, and a 15-seed advancing to the second round in that region.  At the time, 15-seed [[Santa Clara Broncos men's basketball|Santa Clara's]] victory over 2-seed [[Arizona Wildcats men's basketball|Arizona]] was only the second such upset, and following the 2017 tournament, is one of only eight times that a [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship upsets|15-seed defeated a 2-seed]] since the tournament field expanded to 64 teams.

For the third time, the Superdome was the host venue for the Final Four, and for the second straight year, all four regional sites were former or future Final Four sites. 1993 saw two new host cities, in Orlando, Florida and Winston-Salem, North Carolina. This was only the second time (after 1983 in Tampa) that Florida hosted a tournament site. Winston-Salem, by contrast, was the sixth different city in North Carolina to host a tournament game. This was the final year for two venues, Vanderbilt's Memorial Gym and the St. Louis Arena. Games in Nashville have moved to the downtown [[Bridgestone Arena]], and games since in St. Louis have been either at [[The Dome at America's Center]] or the [[Scottrade Center]], the successor venue to the Arena, which was torn down in 1999. This was also the most recent time the Carrier Dome has served as a site for opening weekend games; it has been used as a regional site ever since.

'''*''' Michigan's entire 1992–93 schedule results were vacated, on November 7, 2002, as part of the settlement of the [[University of Michigan basketball scandal]].  Unlike forfeiture, a vacated game does not result in the other school being credited with a win, only with Michigan removing the wins from its own record.
