The '''1999 [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]]''' involved 64 schools playing in [[Single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] play to determine the national champion of men's  [[NCAA Division I]] [[college basketball]]. It began on March 11, 1999, and ended with the [[1999 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] on March 29 at [[Tropicana Field]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]]. A total of 63 games were played. This year's Final Four was the first—and so far, only—to be held in a [[baseball]]-specific facility, as Tropicana Field is home to the [[Tampa Bay Rays]] (then known as the Devil Rays).

The Final Four consisted of [[1998–99 Connecticut Huskies men's basketball team|Connecticut]], making their first ever Final Four appearance; [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball|Ohio State]], making their ninth Final Four appearance and first since 1968; [[1998–99 Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team|Michigan State]], making their third Final Four appearance and first since their 1979 national championship; and [[1998–99 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team|Duke]], the overall number one seed and making their first Final Four appearance since losing the national championship game in 1994.

In the national championship game, Connecticut defeated Duke 77-74 to win their first ever national championship, snapping Duke's 32-game winning streak, and scoring the biggest point-spread upset in Championship Game history. Duke nonetheless tied the record for most games won during a single season, with 37, which they co-held until [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky's]] 38-win seasons in [[2011–12 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|2011–12]] and [[2014–15 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|2014–15]]. The [[2007–08 Memphis Tigers men's basketball team|2007–08 Memphis]] team actually broke this record first, but the team was later forced to forfeit their entire season due to eligibility issues surrounding the team.

[[Richard Hamilton (basketball)|Richard "Rip" Hamilton]] of Connecticut was named the tournament's [[NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]]. This was a significant victory for the program, as it cemented Connecticut's reputation as a true basketball power after decades of barely missing the Final Four. Also, the Huskies were the last men's national champion to date that did not play [[College football|football]] at the level now known as the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Football Bowl Subdivision]] (known as Division I-A from 1978 to 2006) at the time of their title. Connecticut then [[Connecticut Huskies football|played football]] in Division I-AA, now the [[NCAA Division I#Football Championship Subdivision|Football Championship Subdivision]]; by the time of the Huskies' next men's basketball title in [[2003–04 Connecticut Huskies men's basketball team|2004]], the school's football team had upgraded to the current FBS level.

This tournament is also historically notable as the coming-out party for [[Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball|Gonzaga]] as a rising [[mid-major]] power. The Bulldogs became the nation's basketball darlings during a run to the West Regional final in which they defeated three major-conference powers, including [[1998 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1998 Final Four]] participant [[Stanford Cardinal men's basketball|Stanford]], and took UConn literally to the last minute before losing. Gonzaga has made every NCAA tournament since then, and is now generally considered to be a high-major program despite its mid-major [[West Coast Conference|conference affiliation]].

Due to violations committed by Ohio State head coach [[Jim O'Brien (basketball, born 1949)|Jim O'Brien]], the Buckeyes were forced to vacate their appearance in the 1999 Final Four.<ref>[[Jim O'Brien (basketball, born 1949)#Firing controversy|Jim O'Brien – Firing controversy]] (references included)</ref>

St. Petersburg became the 27th host city, and Tropicana Field the 32nd host venue, for the Final Four. Tropicana Field, the home of baseball's [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]], was the sixth different domed stadium to host a Final Four, and the only one designed specifically for baseball; given its inability to be converted to a center court arena, it is unlikely to host one again. There were four new venues in the 1999 tournament, two in completely new host cities for the tournament. For the first time, the tournament came to Boston at the FleetCenter, which had replaced the [[Boston Garden]] in 1995. Despite the original Garden's rich college and NBA history, it never had hosted any NCAA tournament games. The tournament also came to downtown Phoenix for the first time, at the NBA home of the [[Phoenix Suns]]. Previous games in the metropolitan area were played in suburban Tempe at [[Arizona State University]]. For the second straight year, the Midwest Regional games were held in a new venue in St. Louis, this time at the Trans World Dome, then home to the NFL's [[Los Angeles Rams|St. Louis Rams]]. The tournament also returned to Seattle, this time at KeyArena, the downtown home to the [[Seattle SuperSonics]]. This tournament would be the last held at McNichols Sports Arena, which was scheduled to close later in the year and is now the site of parking for [[Sports Authority Field at Mile High]]; subsequent games in Denver have moved to the [[Pepsi Center]]. It is also the last tournament to date to include Tropicana Field and Thompson–Boling Arena, as neither has hosted since.

*[[Craig Bolerjack]] and [[Rolando Blackman]] – First & Second Round at Boston, Massachusetts

==Additional notes==
* Despite their loss in the finals to Connecticut, the 1998–1999 Duke team won 37 games.<ref>{{cite web|title=Men's College Basketball 1998–1999 Chi Square Linear WL – SD |url=http://www.phys.utk.edu/sorensen/cfr/cfr/CBM/1998/CBM_1998_Ranking_sCWS.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gkMGXWiF?url=http://www.phys.utk.edu/sorensen/cfr/cfr/CBM/1998/CBM_1998_Ranking_sCWS.html |archivedate=2009-05-13 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2009-04-06 |df= }}</ref>  This tied them with [[1985–86 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team|Duke's 1985–86 team]], [[1986–87 UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball team|UNLV's 1986–87 squad]], and later, [[2004–05 Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team|Illinois' 2004–05 team]] and [[2007–08 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas's 2007–08 team]], for the most wins in a season, until their record was broken by the 38-win [[2007–08 Memphis Tigers men's basketball team|Memphis]] team in 2007–08.  However, as the NCAA vacated Memphis' 2007–2008 season due to the ineligibility of [[Derrick Rose]], they reclaimed the 37-win record. The mark would once again be raised to 38 wins after [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky's]] dominant title run in 2012, which then tied with Kentucky's 2014–15 team.  Interestingly, only one of the first 5 teams to be the winningest single-season teams won a national championship; UNLV's squad lost in the national semifinal to [[1986–87 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|Indiana]], and the other teams lost in the finals, to [[1985–86 Louisville Cardinals men's basketball team|Louisville]], [[1998–99 Connecticut Huskies men's basketball team|UConn]], and [[2004–05 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|North Carolina]], while Kansas defeated Memphis in the 2008 national championship game.  Kentucky's 2014–15 squad suffered their only loss that season in the national semifinal to [[2014-15 Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball team|Wisconsin]].
* Connecticut's victory in the finals marks the biggest upset in Championship Game history in the NCAA Tournament, as they were 9.5-point underdogs in the contest despite having compiled a 33-2 record going into the Championship game, including a 14-2 record in the tough Big East Conference.  In fact, Connecticut had spent more weeks as the number 1 team in the country, according to the AP Top 25 Poll, than had Duke. The previous record was held by [[1984–85 Villanova Wildcats men's basketball team|Villanova]], who defeated [[1984–85 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team|Georgetown]] as 9-point underdogs in 1985.<ref name="pointspread">{{cite web |url=http://www.goldsheet.com/gs_new/histcbb.php |title=Gold Sheet College Basketball Log |accessdate=29 March 2010 <!--DASHBot--> |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410131625/http://www.goldsheet.com/gs_new/histcbb.php |archivedate=10 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>
* The 1999 Final Four would be the last time Tropicana Field would host NCAA tournament games. For Duke, they had 2 straight promising seasons end on the Tropicana Field floor, with a 86-84 loss to Kentucky in the 1998 South Regional final, and then the 1999 National Championship game.
