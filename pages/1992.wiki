The '''1992 [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]]''' involved 64 schools playing in [[Single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] play to determine the national champion of men's  [[NCAA Division I]] [[college basketball]]. It began on March 19, 1992, and ended with the [[1992 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] on April 6 in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. A total of 63 games were played.

[[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]], coached by [[Mike Krzyzewski]], defeated the Michigan Wolverines, coached by [[Steve Fisher]], 71–51 to claim their second consecutive national championship.<ref>{{YouTube|rBQ4-zr22Nc|1992 NCAA Basketball National Championship Game}}</ref> [[Bobby Hurley]] of Duke was named the tournament's [[NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]]. Michigan subsequently vacated its final two tournament games as part of the [[University of Michigan basketball scandal]].

This tournament is best remembered for the East regional final pitting Duke and [[University of Kentucky|Kentucky]] at [[Spectrum (arena)|The Spectrum]] in Philadelphia. With 2.1 seconds remaining in overtime, Duke trailed 103–102. [[Grant Hill]] threw a pass the length of the court to [[Christian Laettner]], who dribbled once, turned, and hit a jumper as time expired for the 104–103 win.

It is number one on the USA Today list of the greatest NCAA tournament games of all time.<ref>Mike Douchant – [https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/basketball/men/02tourney/greatest-games.htm Greatest 63 games in NCAA Tournament history]. The Sports Xchange, published in USA Today, March 25, 2002</ref> This tournament also saw darkhorse [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Cincinnati]] crash the Final Four en route to returning to national prominence.

For the first time since 1951, Minneapolis was the site of the Final Four, held at the Metrodome, the 28th venue used for the Final Four. Once again, all four arenas used for the regional rounds were former Final Four sites. For the first time, the tournament held games in Massachusetts, at the Centrum in Worcester. Additionally, the tournament came to the new Bradley Arena in Milwaukee, which replaced the MECCA Arena. This tournament would mark the final appearances of Atlanta's Omni Coliseum and the Spectrum in Philadelphia; both have since been replaced. To date, this was the most recent game played in Cincinnati; the tournament is slated to return to the Queen City in 2022.

'''#''' signifies Michigan's final two games, in the 1992 Final Four, were vacated on November 7, 2002, as part of the settlement of the [[University of Michigan basketball scandal]].  Unlike forfeiture, a vacated game does not result in the other school being credited with a win, only with the removal of any Michigan wins from all records.
